## RPC endpoints

querying the node's state and broadcasting transactions on the
Celestia network. The default port is 26657.

Below is a list of RPC endpoints you can use to connect to arabica-9 Devnet:

:::tip Pay attention

### Bridge, full, and light nodes

* `consensus-validator-arabica-9.celestia-arabica.com`
* `validator.consensus-arabica-9.celestia-arabica.com`
* `consensus-full-arabica-9.celestia-arabica.com`

### Full and light nodes ONLY

These RPC endpoints do not allow you to download full blocks from
them. We advise that if you are running a bridge node, that you also
run a local [full consensus node](../nodes/full-consensus-node) in order to download full blocks from
it. 

* `rpc-arabica-9.consensus.celestia-arabica.com`
* `rpc-2-arabica-9.consensus.celestia-arabica.com`

## API endpoints

The API endpoint is to allow users to interact with the REST API in Cosmos
SDK which is implemented using gRPC-gateway, which exposes gRPC endpoints
as REST endpoints. This allows for communication with the node using REST
calls, which can be useful if the client does not support gRPC or HTTP2.
The default port is 1317.

* [https://api-2-arabica-9.consensus.celestia-arabica.com/](https://api-2-arabica-9.consensus.celestia-arabica.com/)

## gRPC endpoints

The gRPC endpoint is to allow users to interact with a Celestia Node using
gRPC, a modern open-source and high-performance RPC framework. The default
port is 9090. In the Cosmos SDK, gRPC is used to define state queries and
broadcast transactions.

* `grpc-arabica-9.consensus.celestia-arabica.com:443`
* `grpc-2-arabica-9.consensus.celestia-arabica.com:443`
* `validator.consensus-arabica-9.celestia-arabica.com:9090`
* `consensus-validator-arabica-9.celestia-arabica.com:9090`
