# Summary

- Modular blockchains prioritize decentralization
for network security by reducing the cost for users
to operate nodes and verify the network.
- Scaling enables modular blockchains to increase
capacity without making it costly for users to
verify and secure the network.
- A decentralized network of users are ultimately
responsible for upholding the security of a
blockchain in the presence of malicious validators.

## Introduction

Learning a concept by starting at its foundation
provides the best path to reaching proficiency.
Like any concept, modular blockchains are no different.
They come with their own set of fundamental concepts
that require understanding to grasp the advanced
material. By beginning with the first principles
of modular blockchains, their purpose and goals
will become easier to understand.

## Decentralization

One of the most important distinctions between
blockchains and traditional distributed systems
is that they are open and verifiable by any
individual. A user can operate a node and personally
verify that the blockchain is operating correctly.
Nodes that fully verify the blockchain, such as
full nodes, are critical to its security because
they are responsible for ensuring that the rules
of the chain are upheld.

Since verifiability is the core difference between
web2 and web3 systems, we measure decentralization
by the amount of users that can verify the chain
directly themselves. More users running nodes
increases decentralization which makes the
blockchain more resilient to attacks. Modular
blockchains prioritize decentralization for
network security by reducing the cost for users
to operate nodes and verify the network.

## Scalability

As users increase, blockchains must also increase
the number of transactions they can process.
However, increasing the number of transactions
a blockchain processes increases the amount of
work required to verify the chain. If it becomes
more difficult to verify the chain, then less
people can run nodes and the blockchain becomes
more centralized.

Transaction throughput measures how many transactions
a blockchain can process, commonly referred to as
transactions per second (TPS). To scale, a blockchain
must increase the number of transactions it can
process without an equal increase in the cost to
operate a secure node.

If a blockchain can increase the number of transactions
it processes without equally increasing the cost for
nodes to verify the transactions, it is scaling.
Scalability is a core property of modular blockchains
which ensures they can increase capacity without making
it costly for users to verify the network. Technologies
like fraud proofs, validity proofs, and data
availability sampling used in the modular blockchain
stack enable nodes to verify transactions more
efficiently than full nodes while maintaining
equivalent security.

## Security

While security covers a broad scope of topics,
one fundamental aspect of blockchain security
relates to the validators or miners. Most Proof
of Stake blockchains have a validator set that
encompasses a group of nodes responsible for
processing transactions and adding them to the
chain.

To participate as a validator, Proof of
Stake blockchains require that nodes stake
tokens as a security deposit. To punish
malicious validators, their stake can be
burnt in a process known as slashing.

Blockchains can only tolerate a certain
threshold of malicious validators until certain
guarantees are lost. However, no matter how
many validators act dishonestly, they canâ€™t
break the rules of the chain. With a robust,
decentralized network of users verifying the
chain, the malicious activities of validators
will be detected and punished.

Punishment can be administered automatically
through slashing, which reduces their stake,
or through social consensus to fork away from
the malicious validators. Ultimately, checks
and balances on power and security are in the
hands of users that verify and uphold the rules
of the chain.
