⚠️ **Note: this release requires a config update and - for BN runners - a migration step.** ⚠️ 
See [docs](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/celestia-node-troubleshooting#resetting-your-config) for further information.

⚠️  **BRIDGE NODE RUNNERS MUST COMPLETE A MIGRATION STEP BEFORE UPGRADING** ⚠️ 

## This release notably introduces...
* a unified share exchange protocol (via [unified shrex](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/pull/4249)), a pre-requisite for sampling over our custom share exchange
* header pruning via https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/pull/4330

## Header pruning

In order to use header pruning, please check out the new header configuration parameters in config.toml: 
```toml
  [Header.Syncer]
    # PruningWindow defines the duration within which headers are retained before being pruned.
    # Default is 337 hours.
    PruningWindow = "337h0m0s"
    # SyncFromHash is the hash of the header from which the syncer should start syncing.
    # Zero value to disable. Value updates up and down the chain are gracefully handled by Syncer.
    #
    # By default, Syncer maintains PruningWindow number of headers. SyncFromHash overrides this default,
    # allowing any user to specify a custom starting point.
    #
    # SyncFromHash has higher priority than SyncFromHeight.
    SyncFromHash = ""
    # SyncFromHeight is the height of the header from which the syncer should start syncing.
    # Zero value to disable. Value updates up and down the chain are gracefully handled by Syncer.
    #
    # By default, Syncer maintains PruningWindow number of headers. SyncFromHeight overrides this default,
    # allowing any user to specify a custom starting point.
    #
    # SyncFromHeight has lower priority than SyncFromHash.
    SyncFromHeight = 0
```    
_Please do not copy these values directly into the config -- please use the `config-update` command. Read the docs [here](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/celestia-node-troubleshooting#resetting-your-config)._
