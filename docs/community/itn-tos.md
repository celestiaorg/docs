Welcome to the Supplemental Terms (these **"ITN Award Program Terms"** or **"Terms"**)
for the Incentivized Testnet Award Program
(the **"ITN Award Program"** or the **"Program"**) as operated on behalf of Strange
Loop Labs AG (**"Company"**, **"we"** or **"us"**). The ITN Award Program provides eligible
users of a Testnet designated by the Company the opportunity to earn rewards,
which may include Celestia tokens. These Terms are supplemental to, and
incorporate by reference, the broader Celestia Terms of Service
(**"Services Terms"**) available at [Celestia Terms of Service](https://celestia.org/tos).

Defined terms used but not defined herein have the meaning set forth in the
Services Terms.  The Program and your participation in it is a Service as
defined under the Services Terms.

These Terms govern your ability to participate in the Program and any awards
you receive from that participation, which may include Celestia tokens (**"ITN Rewards"**).

Please read these Terms carefully, as they include important information about
your legal rights. By participating in the Program or claiming ITN Rewards,
you are agreeing to these Terms.  If you do not understand or agree to these
Terms, please do not participate in the Program or claim ITN Rewards.

In order to participate in the Program you must provide certain information about you.
Our collection of such information, your rights with respect to such collection,
and other relevant information is described in the Celestia Privacy Policy available
at [Celestia Privacy Policy](https://celestia.org/privacy), and is supplemented by
Section 3 of these Terms. 

The Program is a discretionary Service provided by the Company, pursuant to which
the Company may, in its sole discretion, provide you ITN Rewards for your successful
completion of certain tasks on a Testnet designated by the Company. Please note that
any such Testnet itself (as well as any other Testnets or any mainnet deployment of
the Celestia Protocol) is not a Service and does not constitute an element of the
Services. We do not control the Celestia Protocol and accept no liability for its 
operation or its deployment in any testnet or mainnet environment.

## 1.	General Terms

**1.1**	You must be eighteen (18) years of age or older and capable of forming a
  binding contract with the Company in order to participate in the Program
  or receive ITN Rewards.


**1.2**	You agree and acknowledge that you (a) may receive ITN Rewards for free
  (other than applicable taxes, if any) from your participation in the Program,
  (b) were not previously promised ITN Rewards, unless pursuant to a separate
  written agreement, and (c) took no action in anticipation of or in reliance
  on receiving any ITN Rewards, unless pursuant to a separate written agreement.  


**1.3**	Your eligibility to participate in or receive ITN Rewards from the Program
  is subject to our sole discretion. The complete list of actions you must complete
  to earn ITN Rewards may not have been described in the documentation released by
  us from time to time, you may not receive ITN Rewards even if you successfully
  complete such actions, and no documentation related to the Program entitles you
  to any ITN Rewards or to participate in the Program.


**1.4**	You agree and acknowledge that (a) you are not a Prohibited Person, (b) you
  are not a U.S. Person as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the U.S.
  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the **"1933 Act"** or **"Act"**), (c) you will not
  use a VPN or other tool to circumvent any geoblock or other restrictions that
  we may have implemented for participants in the Program, and (d) you are not
  participating in, and have not become eligible to participate in, the Program
  by receiving credentials from any other person or entity. Any circumvention or
  violation of the above will permanently disqualify you from participation in the Program.


**1.5**	You agree and acknowledge that if you are unable to claim ITN Rewards due to
  technical bugs, gas fees, loss of access to a Wallet or the keys thereto, or
  for any other reason, you will have no recourse or claim against us or any other
  Company Entity and that neither we nor any other Company Entity will bear any liability.  


**1.6**	You agree and acknowledge that claiming an ITN Reward may require reliance
  on or an integration with third party products (e.g., a Wallet or an unaffiliated
  network or blockchain) that we do not control. In the event that you are unable to
	access such products or integrations, or if they fail for any reason, and you are
  unable to participate in the Program or claim ITN Rewards, you will have no recourse
  or claim against us or any other Company Entity and neither we nor any other Company
  Entity will bear any liability.  


**1.7**	The Company may share identifying information and documentation with certain vendors
  or third-party providers who provide such identity verification and sanctions and watchlist
  screening services (the **"Third-Party Services"**).  You agree that your access and use of
  such Third-Party Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Third-Party
	Services, and the Company is not responsible or liable for, and make no representations
  as to any aspect of such Third-Party Services, including, without limitation, their content
	or the manner in which they handle, protect, manage or process data or any interaction
	between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services. You irrevocably waive any claim
	against the Company with respect to such Third-Party Services. We are not liable for any damage
  or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your enablement, access or
  use of any such Third-Party Services, or your reliance on the privacy practices, data
  security processes or other policies of such Third-Party Services.

## 2.	Taxes 

**2.1**	You are responsible for the payment of all taxes associated with your participation in
	the Program and your receipt of ITN Rewards. You agree to provide the Company with any
  additional information and complete any required tax or other forms relating to your
	receipt of ITN Rewards. You may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of your
	participation in the Program or your receipt of ITN Rewards. You hereby represent that
  (a) you have consulted with a tax adviser that you deem advisable in connection with
  your participation, or that you have had the opportunity to obtain tax advice but have
  chosen not to do so, (b) the Company has not provided you with any tax advice with respect
  to your participation, and (c) you are not relying on the Company for any tax advice. 

## 3.	Supplemental Privacy Information 

We may collect information to help us determine the reliability or uptime of your activities
within the Program, including through the use of telemetry or metrics endpoints to collect
and analyse such information, and link this information to a unique identifier to represent
your activities within the Program. We may display all of the foregoing information on a
public dashboard. 

Additionally, we may collect certain information about you from Third-Party Services and
may combine information we receive from you with information we obtain from Third-Party
Services, including but not limited to:

  address, activities performed using your Wallet, tokens received by your Wallet, or
  transactions initiated or completed.  
*	<u>Identification information</u>. We collect your government identification (e.g., driver’s
  license, passport, etc.), proof of address, biometric information, and entity formation
  information if applicable. By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to our use of your
  biometric information, and understand and agree that our use of the biometric information
  is necessary for the performance of these Terms and the implementation of the Services.

We collect this information to confirm your eligibility to participate in the Program and receive
ITN Rewards, comply with our legal obligations, detect and prevent fraud, and to
provide you with the Program.

Any information we receive from third-party sources will be treated in accordance with the
Celestia Privacy Policy, available at [Celestia Privacy Policy](https://celestia.org/privacy).
We are not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the information provided to us by third parties
and are not responsible for any third party’s policies or practices. See Section 9 of the Celestia
Privacy Policy for more information.

## 4.	Certain Additional Representations

**4.1**	<u>Receipt of Rewards Entirely for Own Account</u>. Your eligibility to receive ITN Rewards is made
  in reliance upon your representation to the Company, which by your agreement to these Terms you
  hereby confirm, that any ITN Rewards you receive will be for your own account, not as a nominee
  or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and that you have
  no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same.
  By agreeing to these Terms, you further represent that you do not presently have any contract,
  undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations
  to such person or to any third person, with respect to any ITN Rewards. If you are agreeing to
  these terms on behalf of an entity, that entity has not been formed for the specific purpose of
  obtaining the ITN Rewards.


**4.2**	<u>Disclosure of Information</u>. Your eligibility to receive ITN Rewards is made in reliance upon your
  representation to the Company, which by your agreement to these Terms you hereby confirm, that you
  have sufficient knowledge of and experience in business and financial matters to be able to evaluate
  the risks and merits of your participation in the Program and of any ITN Rewards and are able to bear
	the risks thereof. You hereby affirm that you have not relied on any representations or warranties
	made by the Company related to the Program, including, but not limited to, conversations of any kind,
  whether through oral or electronic communication, or any white paper.


**4.3**	<u>Compliance with United States Securities Laws</u>. You understand that the ITN Rewards
  have not been, and will not be, registered under the 1933 Act or any applicable state
  securities laws. You acknowledge that the availability of an exemption from the registration
  provisions of the Securities Act and other applicable state securities laws depends upon,
  among other things, the bona fide nature of your intent as described in Section 4.1 above
  and with respect to the accuracy of your representations as expressed throughout these Terms.
  You understand that the ITN Rewards may be deemed "restricted securities" under applicable
  United States federal and state securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, you may be
  restricted from transferring any ITN Rewards unless they are registered with the Securities
  and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such registration
  and qualification requirements is available. You acknowledge that the Company does not undertake
  any obligation to register or qualify the ITN Rewards for resale, and exemptions from registration
  and qualification may not be available or may not permit you to transfer all or any of the ITN Rewards
  in the amounts or at the times proposed by you. You further acknowledge that if an
  exemption from registration or qualification is available, such exemption may be
  conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner
  of sale, the holding period for the ITN Rewards, and on other factors outside of your
  control, for which the Company makes no assurances and may not be able to satisfy.


**4.4**	<u>Compliance with Liechtenstein Security Law</u>.  You understand that nothing in these
  Terms will be deemed to constitute a prospectus of any sort in Liechtenstein or in
  any jurisdiction in the EU; nor does it in any way pertain to a public offering or
  a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in Liechtenstein or in any
  jurisdiction in the EU.


**4.5**	<u>No Public Market</u>. You understand that no public market now exists for the
  ITN Rewards, and that the Company has not made any assurances that a public
  market will ever exist for the ITN Rewards.


**4.6**	<u>No Solicitation</u>.  At no time were you presented with or solicited by any publicly
  issued or circulated newspaper, mail, radio, television or other form of general
  advertising or solicitation in connection with any invitation to participate in
  the Program or offer of the ITN Rewards.


**4.7**	<u>Other Applicable Laws</u>.  You hereby represent that you have satisfied yourself
  as to the full observance of the laws of your jurisdiction in connection with
  any invitation to participate in the Program, receipt of ITN Awards, and other
  use of these Terms, including (a) the legal requirements within your jurisdiction
  for participating in the Program and receiving ITN Rewards, (b) any foreign exchange
  restrictions applicable to such participation or receipt, (c) any governmental or
  other consents that may need to be obtained, and (d) the income tax and other tax
  consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the receipt, holding, sale, or transfer
  of the ITN Rewards.  Your participation in the Program and continued beneficial
  ownership of ITN Rewards will not violate any applicable securities or other
  laws of your jurisdiction. 


**4.8**	<u>Non-US Transaction</u>.  You are not a U.S. Person as defined in Rule 902(k)
  of Regulation S under the 1933 Act.  The offer of the ITN Rewards to you was
  made in an offshore transaction (as defined in Rule 902(h) of Regulation S),
  no directed selling efforts (as defined in Rule 902(c) of Regulation S) were
  made in the United States, and you are not obtaining the ITN Rewards for the
  account or benefit of any U.S. Person.


**4.9**	<u>Transfer Restrictions</u>.  You will not, during the Restricted Period
  (as defined below) offer or sell any of the ITN Rewards (or create or maintain
  any derivative position equivalent thereto) in the United States, to or for
  the account or benefit of a U.S. Person or other than in accordance with
  Regulation S.  The Company reserves the right to impose additional transfer
  restrictions with respect to the ITN Rewards in its sole discretion. 


**4.10** <u>Subsequent Sales</u>.  You will, after the expiration of the applicable
  Restricted Period, only offer, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer the ITN Rewards
  (or create or maintain any derivative position equivalent thereto) pursuant to
  registration under the 1933 Act or any available exemption therefrom and,
  in any case, in accordance with applicable state securities laws.


**4.11** <u>Legends</u>. You acknowledge and agree that the ITN Rewards will be deemed
  to bear the following legends: (a) any legend required by the securities
  laws of any state or country to the extent such laws are applicable to the
  ITN Rewards represented by the certificate so legended, and (b): the following
