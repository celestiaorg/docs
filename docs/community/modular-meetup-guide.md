## Logistics and guidance

These are provided guidelines for different components of kickstarting
a Modular Meetup to help you get started on the logistics of organizing
a meetup. A lot of those guidelines are thanks to the wonderful write ups
in [Ethereum Meetup Support Program](https://emsp.gitbook.io/ethereum-meetup-support-program/meetup-kit)
and [Elastic Community Organizer Guides](https://www.elastic.co/community/usergroupguide).

### Venue

Selecting the perfect venue for your Modular Meetup is essential in
creating a welcoming atmosphere for the Celestia community.

1. Startup Incubators
   - Often they would have spaces for meetups.
2. Libraries
   - Libraries can normally have spaces for meetups at little to no costs
3. Co-working spaces:
   - Co-working spaces might be able to offer necessary equipment like
     microphones, projectors, and whiteboards.
4. Restaurants:
   - Restaurants might have private rooms for larger groups of people
     that you can book, depending on the restaurant.
5. Universities and Blockchain Clubs:
   - Partnering with universities and their local university clubs can
     offer you a lot of spaces for meetups, as well as necessary equipments
     if needed for giving a talk.
6. Other options:
   - If you're having difficulty finding a venue, don't hesitate to ask
     for help within the Celestia community. Your fellow organizers and
     attendees may have valuable suggestions or connections.

An ideal venue should offer:

- Sufficient seating for the audience
- A projector and screen
- A microphone (especially for meetups with 10+ attendees)
- Optional: A whiteboard for speakers or workshops
  (not always necessary, but a nice addition)

Consider recording the event, even with a smartphone, to share with
the community later. If the speaker uses a microphone, their voice
will be more audible in the video. We might be able to post those
recordings of the meetup talks on a meetup youtube channel after.

Remember to negotiate on costs and seek discounts, emphasizing
that your meetup benefits the community.

Collaborate with your venue provider to explore options like
borrowing recording equipment, tripods, or even having them
record the event for you. Some providers may offer these
services for free or at a reduced cost.

### Catering and refreshments

Providing refreshments or catering for your Modular Meetup
enhances the overall experience and encourages networking
among attendees.

1. Determine your budget
   - Identify the amount you can allocate for food and drinks
     at your event which will help you determine how much you
     can bring in refreshments. You can also contact the Celestia
     Devrel team for ideas and support. Costs for refreshments
     and drinks can vary depending on your location, so be mindful
     to be flexible on your plans according to your specific
     location and budget.
2. Offer a variety of refreshments
   - If you're ordering in, pizza and finger foods work well,
     but you can also have more budget-friendly options for food.
   - Offering drinks like beer, soda, or lemonade are great,
     but water also works. Keep in mind that not everyone drinks
     alcohol so it’s not a requirement. But having at least water
     and plastic cups works well.
3. Plan ahead
   - Order refreshments 1 or 2 days in advance and schedule
     delivery to avoid last-minute stress during the event.

By following these recommendations, you'll be able to provide enjoyable
refreshments for your Celestia Modular Meetup attendees while fostering
a friendly and engaging atmosphere.

### Audience

Understanding your audience and estimating attendance are crucial
for organizing successful Modular Meetups for Celestia.

1. Research the local tech scene:
   - Investigate the types of meetups and events popular in your area.
     Attend other technology-focused events to get a sense of the
     audience size and interests. This information will help you
     tailor your meetup to attract a larger audience.
2. Assess the availability of speakers:
   - Before organizing a meetup, ensure that you have access to a
     pool of knowledgeable speakers. If you anticipate difficulty
     in securing speakers, consider joining forces with an existing
     meetup group or speaking at other events before launching a
     new group. This approach will help spread the word about your
     planned Modular Meetup and gauge interest. Speakers are covered
     in the following section with a reference to Speaker List offered
     by the Modular Meetup program.
3. Establish connections with other user groups:
   - Forge relationships with other tech-focused meetup groups to
     mutually promote each other's events, potentially increasing attendance.
4. Set a regular routine for your meetup:
   - Communicate how often you plan to hold meetups, whether it's monthly or
     quarterly, to help attendees manage their expectations and maintain their interest.
5. Organize casual meetups:
   - If there's a gap between more formal events, arrange casual
     meetups at pubs or cafes to keep people engaged and connect
     with potential speakers for future events.
6. Estimate the number of attendees:
   - Consider factors such as the size of your city, the popularity
     of the topic, and the appeal of the event description when
     estimating attendance.

### Speakers

Securing engaging and knowledgeable speakers is key to hosting
an exceptional Celestia Modular Meetup.

1. Define your event topic
   - Determine the theme of your event, focusing on areas such
     as DeFi, Gaming, NFTs, coding workshops, protocol changes,
     rollups, data availability, or other topics relevant to the
     Modular ecosystem. This will help you find speakers with
     expertise in the chosen subject.
2. Utilize the [Speaker List](./speaker-list.md) provided by the Modular Meetup program
   - As a meetup organizer, you have access to a curated
     list of talented speakers from Celestia Labs and the
     broader Modular ecosystem. This valuable resource can
     connect you with experts who can share their knowledge
     with your meetup attendees.
3. Aim for multiple speakers
   - Ideally, invite 2-3 speakers to your event, allotting 20-40 minutes
     per talk. Schedule short breaks between presentations to maintain
     audience engagement.
4. Organize the speaker lineup
   - Discuss the topics and slides with your speakers before the event
     to ensure a smooth flow. Arrange the talks in a logical order,
     saving the most impactful presentation for last.
5. Invite local speakers
   - For your first meetup, consider presenting an introduction to
     the Celestia ecosystem or a specific area of interest.
     Encourage local experts or enthusiasts to speak at future
     meetups. This approach fosters community involvement and helps
     build a network of potential speakers.
6. Seek speaker referrals
   - Ask your current speakers, attendees, or other meetup
     organizers for referrals. Personal connections often
     lead to discovering new speakers with valuable insights.
7. Leverage your meetup discussion board
   - Post a call for speakers on your meetup discussion board
     to reach out to potential presenters within your community.
     Be clear about the event theme and requirements to attract
     relevant speakers.
8. Offer incentives and appreciation
   - Reward speakers with tokens of gratitude, such as T-shirts,
     gifts, or public recognition, to show your appreciation for
     their contribution to the meetup. The Celestia Labs Devrel
     team can help with swag logistics if needed.

### Sponsors

Finding sponsors for your meetup can be challenging,
but securing financial support is crucial for covering
costs related to venue and refreshments.

1. Leverage Celestia Labs' support
   - Celestia Labs may offer co-sponsorship for your meetup.
     However, they also encourage organizers to find local
     co-sponsors to help cover costs and create a more sustainable event.
2. Offer value to your sponsors:
   - Show potential sponsors how partnering with your
     event will benefit them. Include their logo on event
     banners, mention them in the event description, and
     give them a shoutout at the beginning of the event.
     If they desire, allow them to place a rollup banner
     at the venue.
3. Reach out to your network
   - Ask friends and acquaintances if they know of coworking spaces,
     schools, universities, or companies interested in sponsorship.
     A personal connection can significantly increase the chances
     of securing support.
4. Approach speakers for sponsorship
   - Request speakers or their affiliated projects to contribute
     towards the event's expenses, such as catering costs. This
     can be an effective way to obtain additional funding.
5. Create a sponsorship deck
   - Develop a compelling sponsorship deck to pitch your event
     to tech companies in your city or potential online sponsors.
     This presentation should highlight the benefits of supporting
     your event and showcase past successful meetups.
6. Research local companies
   - Investigate businesses in your area that may be interested in
     sponsoring your event. Tailor your pitch to align with their
     industry and demonstrate how the meetup can benefit their company.
7. Engage sponsors during the event
   - Allow sponsors to briefly address the audience, participate in
     Q&A sessions, or mention their hiring needs. Remember to avoid
     sales pitches, as they can negatively impact the meetup experience.
8. Thank your sponsors
   - Express gratitude to your sponsors at the beginning and end of
     the meetup. Acknowledging their support encourages continued
     collaboration and enhances the credibility of your event.

### Communications and marketing

Effectively marketing and announcing your Modular Meetup is essential
for attracting attendees and ensuring a successful event.

1. Plan your announcement
   - Announce your meetup at least two weeks prior. This gives your
     audience ample time to prepare and increases the likelihood
     of their attendance.
2. Utilize Celestia Labs' resources
   - Celestia Labs can help co-promote your meetup on social media
     and Discord. They can also add your event to their online
     calendar, email local contacts, and share the event via their
     Developer Relations Team on Twitter. Don't hesitate to reach
     out to them for assistance.
3. Share on social media
   - Promote your event on Twitter and any other popular social media
     platforms in your area. Tag speakers, sponsors, and use relevant
     hashtags to increase visibility.
4. Leverage local community groups
   - Post your event in local Telegram, Discord, or other community groups
     relevant to your city. These groups often have many members who may
     be interested in attending your event.
5. Engage speakers and the venue
   - Maintain communication with speakers and the venue to ensure any
     changes can be announced in advance. Trust is critical, so avoid
     canceling planned meetups whenever possible.
6. Send reminders via [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) (optional)
   - After announcing your event, send a warm invite to your meetup
     group members through meetup.com. Additionally, send a reminder
     email one day before the event to encourage attendance.
7. Share with friends and family
   - Invite your friends, family, and acquaintances to the meetup,
     as they may help spread the word or know someone interested in the event.
8. Utilize conference groups
   - If you've attended conferences, share your meetup in the associated
     Telegram or social media groups, as there may be members nearby who
     would be interested in attending.

### Recording

Recording and live-streaming your Modular Meetup can greatly benefit
those who cannot attend in person and expand the reach of your event.

1. Plan for recording
   - Consider recording your meetup to create additional learning
     resources and share the knowledge with a broader audience.
2. Consider live-streaming
   - Live-streaming your event on platforms like Twitch, YouTube,
     or Twitter allows remote participants to watch and engage in
     the meetup. This can also boost your event's reach and create
     a sense of inclusion for those who couldn't attend in person.
3. Coordinate with Celestia Labs
   - Celestia Labs can potentially help cover recording costs and
     promote recorded meetups. Reach out to them at
     [meetups@celestia.org](mailto:meetups@celestia.org) to discuss
     available options and support. They can also assist with finding
     local contacts for recording if you don't have one already.
4. Utilize available resources
   - If you have a small budget, consider allocating some funds for
     recording and live-streaming your event. Look for local professionals
     or affordable equipment rentals to ensure high-quality recordings.
5. Share recordings on Celestia Labs' channels
   - Celestia Labs can help promote recorded meetups by sharing videos
     in their meetups playlist on YouTube and hosting them on their website.
     Ensure you coordinate with Celestia Labs to provide them with the
     recorded video.
6. Promote recorded content
   - Share the recordings on your social media channels and meetup group
     after the event. This helps attendees revisit the content and allows
     those who couldn't attend to learn from the talks.
