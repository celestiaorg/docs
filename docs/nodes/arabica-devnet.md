Arabica Devnet is a new testnet from Celestia Labs that is focused
exclusively on providing developers with enhanced performance and
the latest upgrades for testing their rollups and applications.

Arabica does not focus on validator or consensus-level testing, rather,
that is what Mamaki Testnet is used for. If you are a validator, we
recommend just testing your validator operations on Mamaki [here](./mamaki-testnet.md).

With Arabica having the latest updates from all Celestia's products deployed
on it, it can be subject to many changes. Therefore, as a fair warning,
Arabica can break unexpectedly but given it will be continously updated,
it is a useful way to keep testing the latest changes in the software.

Developers can still deploy on Mamaki Testnet their sovereign rollups if they
chose to do so, it just will always lag behind Arabica Devnet until Mamaki
undergoes Hardfork Upgrades in coordination with Validators.
