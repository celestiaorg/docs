# Upgrade your validator node for the hardfork

## Description

In this phase, the Celestia Network will undergo a Hardfork Upgrade
as an exercise for all Validators.

You can read more about the our hardfork process [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/hardfork-process#blockspace-race-hardfork).

## Directions

1. Upgrade your `celestia-app` binary to version v0.13.0
  ahead of the hardfork block number `446500`. Also, upgrade
  your bridge node version of `celestia-node` to v0.9.2.
2. You will need restart your validator and bridge nodes with the
  new binaries.
3. Maintain high validator uptime after the hardfork activates.

## Judging criteria

1. Full points if you have upgraded to v0.13.0 prior to the
  hardfork block number.
2. No points if you did not upgrade in time.
