# Quick Start Guide

In this section, we show you how to get started
with installing the needed libraries and packages
in Celestia to help you run a node on Celestia.

## Celestia Node

Installing Celestia Node allows you to get started with
running a light node and do Data Availability Sampling.

Light Nodes are the best nodes to test out initially if
you are new to participating in Celestia.

Celestia Node client also allows you to run other types
of Data-Availability nodes like Bridge and Full Storage
nodes, which will be covered in later sections.

## Celestia App

Celestia App is the software that allows you to run
Validator nodes and also provide RPC endpoints.

Celestia App covers the Consensus layer, while Celestia Node
covers the Data Availability layer.

## Getting Started

As covered in the previous section, Celestia offers
two different test networks, [Arabica](./arabica-devnet/)
and [Mocha](./mocha-testnet/).

If you are planning to run a light node, it is recommended
to use Arabica, which you will find options to connecting to
in the later sections.

If you plan on running a validator, your only option is to run
your node on Mocha.

In this Quick Start guide, we will go over installing both of
the software clients: Celestia Node and Celestia App.

> NOTE: If you just want to run a Light Node, you don't need to
  install Celestia App and can skip that part.

Proceed to the next section in order to get started.
