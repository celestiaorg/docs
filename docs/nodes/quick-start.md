# Quick start guide

In this section, we show you how to get started
with installing the needed libraries and packages
in Celestia to help you run a node on Celestia.

## celestia-node

Installing celestia-node allows you to get started with
running a light node and do Data Availability Sampling.

Light Nodes are the best nodes to test out initially if
you are new to participating in Celestia.

celestia-node client also allows you to run other types
of Data-Availability nodes like Bridge and Full Storage
nodes, which will be covered in later sections.

## celestia-app

celestia-app is the software that allows you to run
Validator nodes and also provide RPC endpoints.

celestia-app covers the Consensus layer, while celestia-node
covers the Data Availability layer.

## Getting started

As covered in the previous section, Celestia offers
two different test networks, [Arabica](./arabica-devnet.md)
and [Mocha](./mocha-testnet.md).

If you are planning to run a light node, it is recommended
to use Arabica, which you will find options to connecting to
in the later sections.

If you plan on running a validator, your only option is to run
your node on Mocha.

In this Quick Start guide, we will go over installing both of
the software clients: celestia-node and celestia-app.

> NOTE: If you just want to run a Light Node, you don't need to
  install celestia-app and can skip that part.

Proceed to the next section in order to get started.
