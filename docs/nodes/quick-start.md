# Quick start guide

In this section, we show you how to get started
with installing the needed libraries and packages
in Celestia to help you run a node on Celestia.

## Celestia Node

Installing `celestia-node` allows you to get started with
running a light node and do Data Availability Sampling.

Light Nodes are the best nodes to test out initially if
you are new to participating in Celestia.

`celestia-node` client also allows you to run other types
of Data-Availability nodes like Bridge and Full Storage
nodes, which will be covered in later sections.

## Celestia App

`celestia-app` is the software that allows you to run
validator nodes and also provide RPC endpoints.

`celestia-app` covers the Consensus layer, while `celestia-node`
covers the Data Availability layer.

## Getting started

As covered in the previous section, Celestia offers
two different test networks, [Arabica](./arabica-devnet.mdx)
and [Mocha](./mocha-testnet.mdx).

If you are planning to run a light node, it is recommended
to use Arabica, which you will find options to connecting to
in the later sections.

If you plan on running a validator, your only option is to run
your node on Mocha.

In this Quick Start guide, we will go over installing both of
the software clients: `celestia-node` and `celestia-app`.

> NOTE: If you just want to run a light node, you don't need to
> install `celestia-app` and can skip that part.

Proceed to the next section in order to get started.
