# Blobstream

Blobstream, covered previously in
[the Celestia blog post](https://blog.celestia.org/celestiums/),
introduces the concept of a layer 2 (L2), which is an EVM L2
rollup that uses Celestia for data availability
but settles on Ethereum (or any other EVM L1 chain).

This page and following tutorials will go over Blobstream and how validators on Celestia can run it.

If you're looking to learn more, you can view
[the `orchestrator-relayer` repository](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer),
and [read more about Blobstream](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts#how-it-works).

## Overview

Blobstream,
consists of two components: an [Orchestrator](../blobstream-orchestrator)
and a [Relayer](../blobstream-relayer).

In the following diagram, we show how a layer 2 would post data to
Celestia and then verify that it was published in the target EVM chain.

In fact, data will first be attested to by the Celestia validator set, i.e. signing commitments committing to the data. Then, these signatures will be relayed to the target EVM chain (in this case, Ethereum). Finally,
the layer 2, or any party, will be able to verify that the data was published to Celestia directly on the EVM chain on the Blobstream smart contract. You can
reference
[the Blobstream smart contract](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/src/Blobstream.sol).

The specification of Blobstream `Valset`s, which track the Celestia validator set
changes, can be found in [ADR 002](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-002-qgb-valset.md).

Blobstream data commitments, which represent commitments over sets of blocks
defined by a data commitment window, are
discussed more in-depth in
[ADR 003](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-003-qgb-data-commitments.md).

The Orchestrator is part of the validator setup and works as follows:

- Celestia App: creates an attestation on the state machine level that needs to
  be signed
- The Orchestrator: queries the attestation, signs it, then submits the signature
  to the Blobstream P2P network

The diagram below goes over this process.

The relayer submits the attestations' signatures from the Blobstream P2P network to the target EVM chain.

> **_NOTE:_** If the contract is still not deployed, then it needs to be deployed before its used by the relayer. Check the [deployment documentation](./blobstream-deploy.md) for more details.

The diagram below goes over this process.

You can learn more about the mechanics behind the Relayer in
[ADR 004](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-004-qgb-relayer-security.md).

## Blobstream and data availability committees (DACs)

### Decentralization and security

Blobstream is built on Celestia, which uses a CometBFT-based proof-of-stake
system. An incorrect data availability attestation in this system will ultimately be
penalized (currently not implemented), ensuring validators act in good faith. Thus, Blobstream shares the same security assumptions as Celestia. In contrast, data availability
committees (DACs), are typically centralized or semi-centralized, relying on
a specific set of entities or individuals to vouch for data availability.

### Mechanism of verification

Blobstream uses data availability attestations, which are Merkle roots of the batched
L2 data, to confirm that the necessary data is present on Celestia. The L2 contract
on Ethereum can check directly with Blobstream if the data is published on Celestia. Similarly, a DAC would rely on
attestations or confirmations from its permissioned members.

### Flexibility and scalability

Blobstream is designed to offer high-throughput data availability for Ethereum L2s,
aiming to strike a balance between scalability and security. It operates
independently of Ethereum's gas costs, as Celestia's resource pricing is more
byte-focused rather than computation-centric. On the other hand, the scalability and
flexibility of a DAC would depend on its specific design and implementation.

In summary, both Blobstream and DACs aim to ensure offchain data availability,
but Blobstream offers a more decentralized, secure, and scalable solution
compared to the potential centralized nature of DACs.

## Setting up Blobstream

The following sections in this category presume you have the following setup:

- A Celestia App
  [validator node](../consensus-node#optional-setting-up-a-validator) running

## Next steps

1. [Install the binary](../blobstream-binary)
2. [Blobstream Orchestrator](../blobstream-orchestrator)
3. [Key management](../blobstream-keys)
4. [Blobstream Relayer](../blobstream-relayer)
5. [Deploy the Blobstream contract](../blobstream-deploy)
