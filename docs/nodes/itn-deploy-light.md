# Deploy a light node

## Description

Deploy a Celestia light node and perform Data Availability
Sampling (DAS).

You can find resources on doing this by following the
tutorial [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/light-node).

For an RPC endpoint to connect to, please see the list [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/blockspace-race/#rpc-endpoints).

:::tip
If you encounter errors, please visit the [upgrading your binary](../nodes/celestia-node.mdx#upgrading-your-binary)
and the [troubleshooting](../nodes/celestia-node.mdx#troubleshooting)
sections on the Install Celestia Node page.

The error you may encounter for a light node are:

```bash
error getting latest head during Start: header: not found
```

:::

:::caution
Make sure that the wallet address the node uses is funded.
To find your auto generated wallet by your node, use:

```bash
./cel-key list --node.type light --keyring-backend test --p2p.network blockspacerace
```

The keys directory under
`.celestia-light-blockspacerace-0/keys`
contains your pubkey for both DA and Tendermint networks.
In the leaderboard your pubkey for DA nodes looks similar to this:

```bash
12D3KooWJ3K6x9mXvy9oAJMr2gjeJ45KtU1LH6aL5stKF8YtRkkm
```

If you move the keys folder, you will need to upgrade permissions with:

```bash
chmod 600 keys
```

To learn more, visit the
[Wallet with Celestia Node](../../developers/celestia-node-key/) page.

## Directions

1. Setup Your Celestia light node
2. Perform Data Availability Sampling (DAS).
3. How to find your light node ID is found
  [here](../../developers/node-tutorial/#get-your-node-id).
4. Make sure that the wallet address the node uses is funded.
  To find your auto generated wallet by your node, use
  `./cel-key list --node.type light --keyring-backend test --p2p.network blockspacerace`
5. The keys directory under `.celestia-light-blockspacerace-0/keys`
  contains your `pubkey` for both DA and Tendermint networks. In
  the leaderboard your pubkey for DA nodes looks similar to this
  `12D3KooWSJoAF9pF7AkyEAhQCtNF9TA8JrAujWdqoPJ11uojuKZb`

Please do a backup of the keys directory in order to not lose your progress.
