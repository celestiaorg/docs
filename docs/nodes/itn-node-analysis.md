# Perform analysis of your node

## Description

Perform analysis of your node for any behavior you are interested in.
This applies to any node type you are running whether you are running
a validator or a data-availability node.

Interesting things you can focus on can be hardware performance of the
machine your node is running on, bandwidth used, etc. You can do a write
up of your analysis on a blog post and share the code for how you did the
analysis.

## Directions

1. Perform analysis of your node and do a blog write up.
2. Ensure to share any code scripts you used to perform your
  analysis in your blog post.

## Judging criteria

1. Full points if you submit a clear, concise write up with useful analysis
  of your node.
2. No points if you do not.

## How to submit

Please submit a link to the blog post.
