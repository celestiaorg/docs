# Sign The Genesis Block

## Description

The network cannot start until at least 2/3 of the stake signs the genesis block.
Validators need to have their nodes ready in time but do not actually need to
be present at genesis event although we do recommend being present in case
of any issues.

## Directions

1. Complete validator installation instructions found
  [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/validator-node) and be
  ready to sign the genesis block.

## Judging Criteria

1. Celestia team will track the data to determine which validators
  signed the genesis block and awards points accordingly
