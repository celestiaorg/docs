# Create toolings for the Celestia Network

## Description

Create any useful tool, whether it is a command-line application
or a dashboard tooling, that will be a net-benefit for the Celestia
network, whether for validators, node operators, or developers.

It can target the consensus, data availability or execution layer.

The tool can interact with `celestia-app`, `celestia-node`, or `rollkit`.

You can view our [documentation](https://docs.celestia.org) for ideas
and inspiration.

## Directions

1. Submission is limited to only 1, do not submit more than one.
2. Build a tool that can help strengthens the validator community,
  whether it is an analytics tool, a dev-tool, a command-line script,
  or a useful dashboard.
3. The tool should have supporting documentation or readme.

## Judging criteria

1. Points will be given for creativity and usefulness of the tool.
2. Github repositories must be provided and the code must be open-source.
3. If it is a command-line tool that doesn't run or compile, no point will
  be awarded.
4. Celestia team reserves the right to judge and review tools as they
  see fit, possibly with the help of community.

## Submission

Please submit a link to your tool.
