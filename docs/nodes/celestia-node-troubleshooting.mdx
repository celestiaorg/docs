## Ports

When interacting with a Celestia node,
you may need to open ports on your machine to allow
communication between nodes, such as bridge nodes. It is essential that
specific ports are accessible. Make sure that your firewall allows
connections to the correct ports.

If you run a node on a cloud server, make sure that the ports are open
on the server's firewall. If you run a node at home, make sure that your
router allows connections to the correct ports.

For example, validator ports 9090
and 26657 need to be accessible by the bridge, and port 2121 is
required for P2P connections for all node types.

The following ports are used by Celestia nodes:

| Port  | Protocol | Address   | Description  | Enabled by default on node | Flag                    |
| ----- | -------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2121  | TCP/UDP  | localhost | P2P          | true                       | N/A                     |
| 26658 | HTTP     | localhost | RPC          | true                       | `--rpc.port string`     |
| 26659 | HTTP     | localhost | REST Gateway | false                      | `--gateway.port string` |

:::caution
The gateway endpoints have been deprecated and will be removed in the future. If you would like to use them anyway, you can find more details [here](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/pull/2360).

## Changing the location of your node store

In this section, we'll guide you through starting your node using a
node store in a different location than you originally started with.

First, stop your node safely using `control + C`.

Then, init your node again with a new node store:

```bash
celestia <node-type> init --node.store /home/user/celestia-<node-type>-location/ --p2p.network mocha
```

Next, start your node:

```bash
celestia full start --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --p2p.network mocha --node.store /home/user/celestia-<node-type>-location/
```

If you choose to change the location of your node store,
you will need to execute each command on your node with
the following flag:

```bash
--node.store /home/user/celestia-<node-type>-location/
```

When using `cel-key`, the process is different.
To show the keys you should add `--keyring-dir` like this example:

```bash
./cel-key list --p2p.network mocha --node.type full --keyring-dir /home/user/celestia-<node-type>-location/keys/
```

## Network selection

Note: If you do not select a network, the default network will be 'Mocha'.

```sh
celestia <node-type> init --p2p.network <network>
celestia <node-type> start --p2p.network <network> --core.ip <address> <port>
```

:::tip
Please refer to the [ports](#ports) section for information on
which ports are required to be open on your machine.
:::

> NOTE: It is advised before switching networks to reinitialize
> your node via `init` command. This is due to an old config being present.
> Re-initialisation will reset the config.

## Resetting your config

If you an encounter an error, it is likely that an old config file is present:

```sh
Error: nodebuilder/share: interval must be positive; nodebuilder/core: invalid IP addr given:

# or

Error: nodebuilder/share: interval must be positive
```

You can re-initialize your node's config with the following commands:

:::tip
Save your config so custom values are not lost.
:::

<Tabs groupId="nodever">
<TabItem value="0.9.1" label="v0.9.1 and later">

### All node types on v0.9.1 and later

Run the following command to update your config:

```bash
celestia <node-type> config-update --p2p.network <network>
```

This will pull in any new values from new configuration
and merge them into the existing configuration.

:::tip
After using the `config-update` command, it is encouraged to
double-check that your custom values are preserved.
:::

Then, to start your node again:

```bash
celestia <node-type> start --p2p.network <network>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="0.9.0" label="v0.9.0 and earlier">

### All node types on v0.9.0 and earlier

1. First, remove your config:

```sh
rm ~./<path-to-node-store>/config.toml
```

2. Re-initialize the node:

```sh
celestia <node-type> init --p2p.network <network>
```

:::tip
If you have saved any custom values, add them back to the config.
:::

3. Start the node:

```sh
celestia <node-type> start --p2p.network <network>
```

:::tip
Please refer to the [ports](#ports) section for information on
which ports are required to be open on your machine.

## Clearing the data store

<Tabs groupId="nodever">
<TabItem value="0.9.0" label="v0.9.0 and later">

### Version 0.9.0+

For **bridge, full, and light nodes**,
remove the data store with this command:

```bash
celestia <node-type> unsafe-reset-store --p2p.network <network>
```

### Example for light node on Blockspace Race on v0.9.0+

```bash
celestia light unsafe-reset-store --p2p.network mocha
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="0.8.2" label="v0.8.2 and earlier">

### Bridge and full nodes v0.8.2 and earlier

:::danger
Make sure not to remove anything except the
directories listed below.
:::

1. First, remove the data store:

```sh
rm -rf ~./<path-to-node-store>/data
rm -rf ~./<path-to-node-store>/transients
rm -rf ~./<path-to-node-store>/index
rm -rf ~./<path-to-node-store>/blocks
```

2. Re-initialize the node:

```sh
celestia <node type> init --p2p.network <network>
```

3. Start the node:

```sh
celestia <node type> start --p2p.network <network>
```

:::tip
Please refer to the [ports](#ports) section for information on
which ports are required to be open on your machine.
:::

### Light nodes v0.8.2 and earlier

:::danger
Make sure not to remove anything except the
`<path-to-node-store>/data` directory.
:::

1. First, remove the data store:

```sh
rm -rf ~./<path-to-node-store>/data
```

2. Re-initialize the node:

```sh
celestia light init --p2p.network <network>
```

3. Start the node:

```sh
celestia light start --p2p.network <network>
```

:::tip
Please refer to the [ports](#ports) section for information on
which ports are required to be open on your machine.
:::

#### Example for Blockspace Race on v0.8.2 and earlier

Here's an example for clearing the data store
on Blockspace Race with a light node:

:::danger
Make sure not to remove anything except the
`<path-to-node-store>/data` directory.
:::

```sh
rm -rf ~./celestia-light-mocha-0/data
celestia light init --p2p.network mocha
```

Your output will look similar to below:

```sh
2022-11-01T22:23:19.581+0100	INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:20	Initializing Light Node Store over '/Users/joshstein/.celestia-light-mocha-0'
2022-11-01T22:23:19.582+0100	INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:51	Saving config	{"path": "/Users/joshstein/.celestia-light-mocha-0/config.toml"}
2022-11-01T22:23:19.582+0100	INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:52	Node Store initialized
```

Then start your node:

```sh
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip <address>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## FATAL headers given to the heightSub are in the wrong order

If you observe a FATAL log line like:

```log
FATAL	header/store	store/heightsub.go:87	PLEASE FILE A BUG REPORT: headers given to the heightSub are in the wrong order"
```

then it is possible the celestia-node `data/` directory contains headers from a
previous instance of the network that you are currently trying to run against.
One resolution strategy is to delete the existing celestia-node config for the
target network and re-initialize it:

```sh
# rm -rf ~/.celestia-<node-type>-<network>
rm -rf ~/.celestia-bridge-private

# celestia <node-type> init --p2p.network <network>
celestia bridge init --p2p.network private
```
