# Create and Submit Your Address For Mainnet to Receive Rewards

## Description

Create and submit your address for Celestia on which you want to
claim your Mainnet rewards for your participation in the incentivized
testnet. You can learn about how to create a Celestia address [here](https://docs.celestia.org/category/create-a-celestia-wallet).

Please ensure you have backed up your seed phrase and/or
private key for the wallet. If you lose access to it, you
will lose your rewards. DO NOT use any of your testnet
addresses. Create a new one specifically to receive the mainnet rewards.

## Directions

1. Create a NEW celestia wallet address.
2. Submit it in the form so we know which address to use.

## Judging Criteria

1. Full points if you submit your address in time.
2. No points if you do not.
