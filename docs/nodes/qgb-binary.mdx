# Install the QGB binary

import constants from "../constants/constants.js";
import InlineText from "@site/src/components/InlineText.js";

The [orchestrator](../qgb-orchestrator) is the software that signs the
QGB attestations, and the [relayer](../qgb-relayer) is the one that
relays them to the target EVM chain.

## Install

```mdx-code-block
1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) <InlineText constant={constants.golangQGB} />
2. Clone the `https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer` repository:

    <pre><code>
    git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer.git<br />
    cd orchestrator-relayer<br />
    git checkout {constants.orchrelayVersion}<br />
    </code></pre>
```

3. Install the QGB CLI

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

## Usage

```sh
# Print help
qgb --help
```

## How to run

If you are a Celestia-app validator, all you need to do is run the
orchestrator. Check [here](../qgb-orchestrator) for more details.

If you want to post commitments on an EVM chain, you will need to deploy
a new QGB contract and run a relayer. Check [here](../qgb-relayer) for
relayer docs and [here](../qgb-deploy) for how to deploy a new QGB
contract.

Note: the QGB P2P network is a separate network than the consensus or
the data availability one. Thus, you will need its specific
bootstrappers to be able to connect to it.
