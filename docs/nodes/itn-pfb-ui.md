# Create a UI for submitting PayForBlob transactions

## Description

Create a UI for allowing users to submit PayForBlob Transactions.
You can check out the Node tutorial [here](../../developers/node-tutorial).
It shows you how you can call the API in order to
[submit a PFB transaction](../../developers/node-tutorial/#submit-a-pfb-transaction),
and how to
[retrieve the data](../../developers/node-tutorial/#get-namespaced-shares-by-block-height)
by block height and namespace.

## Directions

1. Submission is limited to only 1, do not submit more than one.
2. Create a UI for submitting a PFB transaction.
3. Ensure it is open source and share the Github repository as well.

## Judging criteria

1. Full points if you have a working UI that allows folks to submit a PFB
transaction and the dashboard is open-source.
2. No points if not.

## How to submit

Please submit the link to the UI and the Github repository.
