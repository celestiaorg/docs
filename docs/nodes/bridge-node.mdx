# Setting up a Celestia bridge node

This tutorial will go over the steps to setting up your Celestia Bridge node.

Bridge nodes connect the data availability layer and the consensus layer.

Validators do not have to run bridge nodes, but are encouraged to in order
to relay blocks to the data availability network.

## Overview of bridge nodes

A Celestia bridge node has the following properties:

1. Import and process ‚Äúraw‚Äù headers & blocks from a trusted Core process
   (meaning a trusted RPC connection to a celestia-core node) in the
   Consensus network. Bridge Nodes can run this Core process internally
   (embedded) or simply connect to a remote endpoint. Bridge Nodes also
   have the option of being an active validator in the Consensus network.
2. Validate and erasure code the ‚Äúraw‚Äù blocks
3. Supply block shares with data availability headers to Light Nodes in the DA network.

From an implementation perspective, Bridge Nodes run two separate processes:

1. celestia-app with celestia-core
   ([see repo](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app))

    * **celestia-app** is the state machine where the application and the
      proof-of-stake logic is run. celestia-app is built on
      [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) and also encompasses
      **celestia-core**.
    * **celestia-core** is the state interaction, consensus and block production
      layer. celestia-core is built on [Tendermint Core](https://docs.tendermint.com),
      modified to store data roots of erasure coded blocks among other changes
      ([see ADRs](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/tree/master/docs/celestia-architecture)).

2. celestia-node ([see repo](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node))

    * **celestia-node** augments the above with a separate libp2p network that
      serves data availability sampling requests. The team sometimes refers to
      this as the ‚Äúhalo‚Äù network.

## Hardware requirements

The following hardware minimum requirements are recommended for running the
bridge node:

* Memory: 8 GB RAM
* CPU: 6 cores
* Disk: 500 GB SSD Storage
* Bandwidth: 1 Gbps for Download/100 Mbps for Upload

## Setting up your bridge node

The following tutorial is done on an Ubuntu Linux 20.04 (LTS) x64 instance machine.

### Setup the dependencies

Follow the tutorial here installing the dependencies [here](./environment.mdx).

## Deploy the Celestia bridge node

### Install celestia-node

Install the celestia-node binary, which will be used to run the Bridge Node.

Follow the tutorial for installing celestia-node [here](./celestia-node.mdx).

### Initialize the bridge node

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="network">
<TabItem value="blockspacerace" label="blockspacerace">

Run the following:

```sh
celestia bridge init --core.ip <ip-address> --p2p.network blockspacerace
```

> NOTE: The `--core.ip` gRPC port defaults to 9090, so if you do not specify
  it in the command line, it will default to that port. You can add the port
  after the IP address or use the  `--core.grpc.port` flag to specify another
  port if you prefer.

If you need a list of RPC endpoints to connect to, you can check from the list [here](../blockspace-race)

Here is an example of initializing the bridge node:

```sh
celestia bridge init --core.ip <ip-address> --p2p.network blockspacerace
```

### Run the bridge node

<Tabs groupId="network">
<TabItem value="blockspacerace" label="blockspacerace">

Start the Bridge Node with a connection to a validator node's gRPC endpoint
(which is usually exposed on port 9090):

```sh
celestia bridge start --core.ip <ip-address> --p2p.network blockspacerace
```

> NOTE: The `--core.ip` gRPC port defaults to 9090, so if you do not specify
  it in the command line, it will default to that port. You can add the port
  after the IP address or use the  `--core.grpc.port` flag to specify another
  port if you prefer.

If you need a list of RPC endpoints to connect to, you can check from the list [here](../blockspace-race)

Here is an example of starting the bridge node:

```sh
celestia bridge start --core.ip <ip-address> --p2p.network blockspacerace
```

You can create your key for your node by following the `cel-key` instructions [here](../../developers/celestia-node-key)

Once you start the Bridge Node, a wallet key will be generated for you.
You will need to fund that address with Testnet tokens to pay for
`PayForBlob` transactions.
You can find the address by running the following command:

```sh
./cel-key list --node.type bridge --keyring-backend test --p2p.network <network>
```

You can get testnet tokens from:

* [Blockspace Race](../arabica-devnet)

```sh

You can get testnet tokens from:

* [Mocha](../mocha-testnet)

> NOTE: If you are running a bridge node for your validator
  it is highly recommended to request Mocha testnet tokens
  as this is the testnet used to test out validator operations.

#### Optional: run the bridge node with a custom key

In order to run a bridge node using a custom key:

1. The custom key must exist inside the celestia bridge node directory at the
   correct path (default: `~/.celestia-bridge/keys/keyring-test`)
2. The name of the custom key must be passed upon `start`, like so:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="network">
<TabItem value="blockspacerace" label="blockspacerace">

```sh
celestia bridge start --core.ip <ip> --keyring.accname <name_of_custom_key> --p2p.network blockspacerace
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mocha" label="Mocha">

```sh
celestia bridge start --core.ip <ip> --keyring.accname <name_of_custom_key>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arabica" label="Arabica üèóÔ∏è">

```sh
celestia bridge start --core.ip <ip> --keyring.accname <name_of_custom_key> --p2p.network arabica
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

### Optional: start the bridge node with SystemD

Follow the tutorial on setting up the bridge node as a background process with
SystemD [here](./systemd.md).

You have successfully set up a bridge node that is syncing with the network.
