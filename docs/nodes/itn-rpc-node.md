# Run a public RPC node

## Description

Run a publicly-available RPC Node (preferraly with seed mode).
You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/full-consensus-node)
for running `celestia-app` to provide an RPC endpoint.

## Directions

1. Run a publicly-available RPC node by following the
  Full Consensus Node tutorial.
2. Provide the IP and port of the available RPC node to the community
  and ensure the correct ports are open so that the community
  can use it.
3. Please submit a PR to our docs with your RPC [here](https://github.com/celestiaorg/docs/blob/main/docs/nodes/blockspace-race.mdx#rpc-endpoints).

## Judging criteria

1. Full points if your RPC node is available for use by others and Data Availability
  nodes can connect to it.
2. No points if not.

## How to submit

Please submit your node's IP and port. Make sure it is accessible to
the internet in case you have a firewall set up.

Submission link can be found [here](https://celestia.knack.com/theblockspacerace#testnet-portal).
