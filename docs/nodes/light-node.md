# Setting Up A Celestia Light Node

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Celestia Light Node,
which can allow you to do data-sampling on the Data Availability (DA)
network.

## Overview of Light Nodes

Light nodes (CLN) ensure data availability. This is the most common
way to interact with the Celestia network.

> Note: In future implementations, Light Nodes can also publish
  transactions ([see ADR](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/blob/main/docs/adr/adr-004-state-interaction.md)),
  though in Mamaki, transactions are left to Bridge Nodes.

Light Nodes have the following properties:

1. Listen for ExtendedHeaders, i.e. wrapped “raw” headers, that notify
   Celestia Nodes of new block headers and relevant DA metadata.
2. Perform data availability sampling (DAS) on the received headers

## Hardware Requirements

The following hardware minimum requirements are recommended for running
the light node:

* Memory: 2 GB RAM
* CPU: Single Core
* Disk: 5 GB SSD Storage
* Bandwidth: 56 Kbps for Download/56 Kbps for Upload

## Setting Up Your Light Node

The following tutorial is done on an Ubuntu Linux 20.04 (LTS) x64 instance machine.

### Setup The Dependencies

Follow the tutorial on setting up your dependencies [here](../developers/environment).

## Install Celestia Node

> Note: Make sure that you have at least 5+ Gb of free space for Celestia Light Node

Follow the tutorial on installing Celestia Node [here](../developers/celestia-node)

### Initialize the Light Node

Run the following command:

```sh
celestia light init
```

### Start the Light Node

Start the Light Node with a connection to a validator node's gRPC endpoint (which
is usually exposed on port 9090):

> NOTE: In order for access to the ability to get/submit state-related information,
  such as the ability to submit PayForData transactions, or query for the node's
  account balance, a gRPC endpoint of a validator (core) node must be passed as
  directed below.

```sh
celestia light start --core.grpc <ip>:9090
```

If you need a list of RPC endpoints to connect to, you can check from the list [here](../nodes/mamaki-testnet#rpc-endpoints)

### Optional: Run the Light Node with a Custom Key

In order to run a light node using a custom key:

1. The custom key must exist inside the celestia light node directory at the
   correct path (default: `~/.celestia-light/keys/keyring-test`)
2. The name of the custom key must be passed upon `start`, like so:

```sh
celestia light start --core.grpc <ip>:9090 --keyring.accname <name_of_custom_key>
```

### Optional: Start Light Node with SystemD

Follow the tutorial on setting up the light node as a background
process with SystemD [here](../nodes/systemd#celestia-light-node).

## Data Availability Sampling (DAS)

With your Light Node running, you can check out this tutorial on
submitting `PayForData` transactions [here](../../developers/node-tutorial).
