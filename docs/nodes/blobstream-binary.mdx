# Install the Blobstream binary

import constants from "../constants/constants.js";
import InlineText from "@site/src/components/InlineText.js";

The [orchestrator](../blobstream-orchestrator) is the software that signs the
Blobstream attestations, and the [relayer](../blobstream-relayer) is the one that
relays them to the target EVM chain.

## Install

```mdx-code-block
1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) <InlineText constant={constants.golangBlobstream} />
2. Clone the `https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer` repository:

    <pre><code>
    git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer.git<br />
    cd orchestrator-relayer<br />
    git checkout {constants.orchrelayVersion}<br />
    </code></pre>
```

3. Install the Blobstream CLI

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

## Usage

```sh
# Print help
blobstream --help
```

## How to run

If you are a Celestia-app validator, all you need to do is run the
orchestrator. Check out [the Blobstream orchestrator page](../blobstream-orchestrator) for more details.

If you want to post commitments on an EVM chain, you will need to deploy
a new Blobstream contract and run a relayer. Check out [the Blobstream relayer page](../blobstream-relayer) for
relayer docs and [the Blobstream deployment page](../blobstream-deploy) for how to deploy a new Blobstream
contract.

Note: the Blobstream P2P network is a separate network than the consensus or
the data availability one. Thus, you will need its specific
bootstrappers to be able to connect to it.

### Tools

1. Install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)
2. Install [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)

### Helpful Commands

```sh
# Build a new orchestrator-relayer binary and output to build/blobstream
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Format code with linters (this assumes golangci-lint and markdownlint are installed)
make fmt
```
