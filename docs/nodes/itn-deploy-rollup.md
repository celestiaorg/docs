# Deploy a sovereign rollup

## Description

Deploy a Sovereign Rollup with Rollkit.

It can be a regular Cosmos-SDK rollup or an Ethermint Rollup.
You can find tutorials on deploying sovereign rollups with
Rollkit [here](https://rollkit.dev/tutorials/building-and-deploying-a-rollup).

## Direction

1. Submission is limited to only 1, do not submit more than
one.
2. Deploy your own sovereign rollup on top of the Blockspace Race network.
3. If deploying a Cosmos-SDK rollup, extra points are given if
  your rollup has unique functionality.
4. If deploying an existing Cosmos-SDK app as a rollup on top of
  Celestia, that would be also great to see.
5. You can also deploy an Ethermint or Cosmwasm rollup with
  a special application built on top of it.

## Judging criteria

1. Full points awarded for deploying your own unique rollup
  with documentation. Extra points awarded if you can write up
  a deployment script to allow anyone to deploy a Cosmos-SDK rollup
  with Rollkit.
2. No points if deploying a vanilla rollup (like just copying what is
  in the docs). Furthermore, no points given if you don't provide a Github
  repository.

## Submission

You need to submit both an open-sourced Github repository and a writeup
on what you built, either as a Medium post or a README on the Github repo.

Submission link can be found [here](https://celestia.knack.com/theblockspacerace#testnet-portal).
