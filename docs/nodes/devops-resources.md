# DevOps Resources

This section will be provide an overview of different available resources
for Developers and Node Operators looking to test out Celestia architecture.

## Docker Compose

* One resource for playing with Docker Compose for Celestia infrastructure
  is the [ephemeral-cluster](https://github.com/celestiaorg/ephemeral-cluster)
  repository. This repository provides infrastructure for doing integration
  testings for development by running a Docker Compose instance of Celestia
  devnet. It is not recommended to be used as-is for running nodes individually.
