# Maintain High Validator Uptime

## Description

Ensure your validator has a high up-time for the duration of
the Blockspace Race, including during pauses.

Please note that there are tasks and phases where you will
likely have some downtime, so please ensure you have the
best possible uptime outside of those events.

## Directions

1. Ensure your validator does not go offline otherwise it
impacts your uptime score.

## Judging Criteria

1. Points are awarded based on the following [formula](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=y%3D1.08%5Ex%2F1.08%5E100+from+0+to+100).
2. `validator_uptime = total_signed_blocks/network_height`
