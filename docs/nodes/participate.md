# Participate in the Celestia testnets

Celestia currently has two existing testnets that will enable participation:

* [Arabica devnet](./arabica-devnet.md): A devnet focused on developers who
  want to deploy sovereign rollups on the latest changes from Celestia's codebase.
  Arabica will be updated frequently and might be unstable at times given new updates.
  Validators won't be able to validate on Arabica as it is not designed for
  validators to participate.
* [Mocha testnet](./mocha-testnet.md): A testnet focused on enabling validators
  to test out their infrastructure by running nodes connected to the network. Developers
  can also deploy sovereign rollups on Mocha, it just will always be behind Arabica
  as Mocha upgrades are slower given they need to be done via hardforks in coordination
  with the validator community on Mocha.
