# Deciding which node to run

Now that you have installed the basic dependencies,
you can start exploring which nodes to run!

## Beginner

It is highly recommended if you are a beginner to
get started with running a Data-Availability light node.

In order to get started, you can proceed to the
[light node section](./light-node.mdx).

You can also play around with the Data Availability API
in [this tutorial for the light node](../developers/node-tutorial.mdx).

## Advanced

If you are looking to run a validator, please follow the
[tutorial for running a validator](../consensus-node#optional-setting-up-a-validator).

Note that running a validator means you must also run a bridge node,
which is covered in [this section](./bridge-node.mdx).
