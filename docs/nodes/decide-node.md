# Deciding which node to run

Now that you have installed the basic dependencies,
you can start exploring which nodes to run!

## Beginner

It is highly recommended if you are a beginner to
get started with running a Data-Availability Light Node.

In order to get started, you can proceed to the
Light Node section [here](./light-node.mdx).

You can also play around with the Data Availability API
in this tutorial for the Light Node [here](../developers/node-tutorial.mdx).

## Advanced

If you are looking to run a validator, please follow the tutorial
for running a validator [here](./validator-node.md).

Note that running a validator means you must also run a bridge node,
which is covered [here](./bridge-node.mdx).
