# Overview to running nodes on Celestia

There are many ways you can participate in the Celestia network.

Celestia node operators can run several options on the network.

Consensus:

- [Validator node](../consensus-node#optional-setting-up-a-validator):
  This type of node participates
  in consensus by producing and voting on blocks.
- [Full consensus node](../consensus-node): A `celestia-app` Full node
  to sync blockchain history.

Data Availability:

- [Bridge node](../bridge-node): This node bridges blocks between the
  Data-Availability network and the Consensus network.
- [Full storage node](../full-storage-node): This node stores all
  the data but does not connect to Consensus.
- [Light node](../light-node): Light clients conduct data availability
  sampling on the Data Availability network.

You can learn more about how to setup each different node by going through
each tutorial guide.
