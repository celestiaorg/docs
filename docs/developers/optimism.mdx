# Deploy an OP Stack testnet with Celestia

In order to deploy a testnet with Celestia, you will need to have a modified
version of optimism-bedrock. You can find the steps to install dependencies
and the modified version [here](../optimism-devnet).

## Pick your deployment type

Using Celestia and OP stack, you have the option to either
run a light node of your own or a `local-celestia-devnet`,
which will give you a local devnet to test things out with.

### Using a local devnet

If you'd like to use the `local-celestia-devnet`, you're in luck!
This is the default for the OP Stack + Celestia repository. Head
to the [previous page](../optimism-devnet) to get started.

#### Using a light node

If you choose to use your own node store, the light node
must be **fully synced** and **funded** for you to be able to submit
and retreive `PayForBlobs`.

If it is not synced, you will run into [errors](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/issues/2151).

Visit the [Blockspace Race page](../../nodes/blockspace-race/)
to visit the faucet.

When using your own node, the RPC URL is set to the Docker
bridge IP, which means you will need to run your node with the
gateway IP address of `172.17.0.1` on port `26659`.

An example start command would look like:

```bash
celestia light start --core.ip https://rpc-blockspacerace.pops.one --gateway --gateway.addr 172.17.0.1 --gateway.port 26659 --p2p.network blockspacerace
```

If you have your own setup you'd like to try, you can always edit
`optimism/ops-bedrock/docker-compose-testnet.yml` to work with your setup.

#### Caldera: Using a RaaS provider

If you'd like to use a RaaS provider, you can do so by...

## Start the testnet

First, make sure your light node is running and funded.

Next, you can start up the testnet with the following command:

```bash
make testnet-up
```

## View the logs of the testnet

If you'd like to view the logs of the testnet, run the following command
from the root of the Optimism directory:

```bash
make testnet-logs
```

## Stop the testnet

To safely stop the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-down
```

## Clean the testnet

To remove all data from the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-clean
```
