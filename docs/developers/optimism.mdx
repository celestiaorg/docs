# Deploy an OP Stack testnet with Celestia

In order to deploy a testnet with Celestia, you will need to have a modified
version of `optimism-bedrock`. You can find the steps to install dependencies
and the modified version [here](../optimism-devnet).

## Pick your deployment type

Using Celestia and OP stack, you have the option to either
run a light node of your own or a `local-celestia-devnet`,
which will give you a local devnet to test things out with.

### Using a local devnet

If you'd like to use the `local-celestia-devnet`, you're in luck!
This is the default for the OP Stack + Celestia repository. Head
to the [previous page](../optimism-devnet) to get started.

### Using a light node

:::caution
This is a beta integration and we are working on a fix due to unexpected
reorgs. The compatible version of the `celestia-node`
software is `v0.9.5`.

In order to allow your light node to post
and retrieve data without errors, you will need to change `UseShareExchange`
to `false` in the `.celestia-light-blockspacerace-0/config.toml` file.

This will be fixed in an official release in the future.
:::

If you choose to use your own node store, the light node
must be **fully synced** and **funded** for you to be able to submit
and retreive `PayForBlobs` to a Celestia network.

If it is not synced, you will run into [errors](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/issues/2151).

Visit the [Blockspace Race page](../../nodes/blockspace-race/)
to visit the faucet.

In order to mount existing data, you must have a node store that is
in the `$HOME/.celestia<node-type>-<network>` directory. This is the
default location of the node store when you initialize and run
a new Celestia node.

:::caution
The user in the `docker-compose-testnet.yml` is the `root` user,
but this is not meant to be used in production.
:::

By default, the node will run with the account named
`my_celes_key`.

If you have your own setup you'd like to try, you can always edit
`optimism/ops-bedrock/docker-compose-testnet.yml` to work with your setup.

### Using a RaaS provider

If you'd like to use a Rollups as a Service (RaaS) provider, you can do so
by going to the [RaaS category](../../category/rollups-as-a-service/).

## Start the testnet

First, make sure your light node is synced and funded.

Next, you can start up the testnet with the following command:

```bash
make testnet-up
```

## View the logs of the testnet

If you'd like to view the logs of the testnet, run the following command
from the root of the Optimism directory:

```bash
make testnet-logs
```

## Stop the testnet

To safely stop the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-down
```

## Clean the testnet

To remove all data from the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-clean
```
