# Deploy an OP Stack testnet with Celestia

In order to deploy a testnet with Celestia, you will need to have a modified
version of `optimism-bedrock`. You can find the steps to install dependencies
and the modified version [here](../optimism-devnet).

## Pick your deployment type

Using Celestia and OP stack, you have the option to either
run a light node of your own or a `local-celestia-devnet`,
which will give you a local devnet to test things out with.

### Using a local devnet

If you'd like to use the `local-celestia-devnet`, you're in luck!
This is the default for the OP Stack + Celestia repository. Head
to the [previous page](../optimism-devnet) to get started.

#### Using a light node

If you choose to use your own node store, the light node
must be **fully synced** and **funded** for you to be able to submit
and retreive `PayForBlobs` to a Celestia network.

If it is not synced, you will run into [errors](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/issues/2151).

Visit the [Blockspace Race page](../../nodes/blockspace-race/)
to visit the faucet.

:::tip Note
In order to mount existing data, you must have a node store that is
in the `$HOME/optimism/op-celestia/blockspacerace-data/` directory. In order
to move an existing node store to this location, you can copy it
to the directory. This will also preserve your original store.

```bash
cp -r $HOME/.celestia-light-blockspacerace-0 $HOME/optimism/op-celestia/blockspacerace-data/
```
:::

By default, the node will run with the account named
`my_celes_key`.

If you have your own setup you'd like to try, you can always edit
`optimism/ops-bedrock/docker-compose-testnet.yml` to work with your setup.

#### Using a RaaS provider

If you'd like to use a Rollups as a Service (RaaS) provider, you can do so
by going to the [RaaS category](../../category/rollups-as-a-service/).

## Start the testnet

First, make sure your light node is synced and funded.

Next, you can start up the testnet with the following command:

```bash
make testnet-up
```

## View the logs of the testnet

If you'd like to view the logs of the testnet, run the following command
from the root of the Optimism directory:

```bash
make testnet-logs
```

## Stop the testnet

To safely stop the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-down
```

## Clean the testnet

To remove all data from the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-clean
```
