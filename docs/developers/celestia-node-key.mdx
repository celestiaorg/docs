# Create A Wallet with Celestia Node

This tutorial will go over using the `cel-key` utility
to generate a wallet on Celestia Node.

While this tutorial will go over installation process
of `cel-key`, it is recommended that you complete
the following prerequisites first:

* [Setting Up Your Environment](../nodes/environment.mdx)

Once you completed the prerequisite, you can proceed with this
tutorial.

## Using the `cel-key` utility

Inside the `celestia-node` repository is a utility called `cel-key` that uses
the key utility provided by Cosmos-SDK under the hood. The utility can be
used to `add`, `delete`, and manage keys for any DA node
type `(bridge || full || light)`, or just keys in general.

### Installation

You need to first pull down the `celestia-node` repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node.git
cd celestia-node/
```

It can be built using either of the following commands:

```sh
# dumps binary in current working directory, accessible via `./cel-key`
make cel-key
```

or

```sh
# installs binary in GOBIN path, accessible via `cel-key`
make install-key
```

For the purpose of this guide, we will use the `make cel-key` command.

### Steps for generating node keys

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="node-type">
<TabItem value="bridge" label="Bridge">

To generate a key for a Celestia bridge node, do the following:

```sh
./cel-key add <key-name> --keyring-backend test --node.type bridge --p2p.network <network>
```

This will load the key `<key-name>` into the directory of the bridge node.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="full" label="Full">

To generate a key for a Celestia full node, do the following:

```sh
./cel-key add <key-name> --keyring-backend test --node.type full --p2p.network <network>
```

This will load the key `<key-name>` into the directory of the full node.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="light" label="Light">

To generate a key for a Celestia light node, do the following:

```sh
./cel-key add <key-name> --keyring-backend test --node.type light --p2p.network <network>
```

This will load the key `<key-name>` into the directory of the light node.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Further flags you can use to customize your key are the following:

* `--node.store`: Specifies a different directory you can use to
  save your node data and configurations. Expects a path to a directory.
* `--p2p.network`: Specifies which network you want the key for. Values
  are `arabica` and `mocha`. Please note the default network will be `mocha`.

Keep in mind that your Celestia Node will only pick up keys that 
are inside the `node.store` directory under `/keys` so you should make
sure to point `cel-key` utility to the correct directory via the
`node.store` or `p2p.network` flags if you have specified a custom
directory or network other than Mocha.

Also keep in mind that if you do not specify a network with `--p2p.network`,
the default one will always be `mocha`.

### Steps for exporting node keys

<Tabs groupId="node-type">
<TabItem value="bridge" label="Bridge">

You can export a private key from the local keyring in encrypted and ASCII-armored format.

```sh
./cel-key export <key-name> --keyring-backend test --node.type bridge --p2p.network <network>
```

You can then import your key with `celestia-appd`:

```sh
celestia-appd keys import <new-key-name> 
  <key-file-location>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="full" label="Full">

You can export a private key from the local keyring in encrypted and ASCII-armored format.

```sh
./cel-key export <key-name> --keyring-backend test --node.type full --p2p.network <network>
```

You can then import your key with `celestia-appd`:

```sh
celestia-appd keys import <new-key-name> 
  <key-file-location>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="light" label="Light">

You can export a private key from the local keyring in encrypted and ASCII-armored format.

```sh
./cel-key export <key-name> --keyring-backend test --node.type light --p2p.network <network>
```

You can then import your key with `celestia-appd`:

```sh
celestia-appd keys import <new-key-name> 
  <key-file-location>
```

</Tabs>

### Steps for importing node keys

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="node-type">
<TabItem value="bridge" label="Bridge">

Importing from a mnemonic:

```sh
./cel-key add <key-name> --recover --keyring-backend test --node.type bridge --p2p.network <network>
```

You will then be prompted to enter your bip39 mnemonic.

Example:

```sh
./cel-key add alice --recover --keyring-backend test --node.type bridge --p2p.network <network>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="full" label="Full">

Importing from a mnemonic:

```sh
./cel-key add <key-name> --recover --keyring-backend test --node.type full --p2p.network <network>
```

You will then be prompted to enter your bip39 mnemonic.

Example:

```sh
./cel-key add alice --recover --keyring-backend test --node.type full --p2p.network <network>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="light" label="Light">

Importing from a mnemonic:

```sh
./cel-key add <key-name> --recover --keyring-backend test --node.type light --p2p.network <network>
```

You will then be prompted to enter your bip39 mnemonic.

Example:

```sh
./cel-key add alice --recover --keyring-backend test --node.type light --p2p.network <network>
```

### View all options for `cel-key`

```sh
$ ./cel-key --help
Keyring management commands. These keys may be in any format supported by the
Tendermint crypto library and can be used by light-clients, full nodes, or any other application
that needs to sign with a private key.

The keyring supports the following backends:

    os          Uses the operating system's default credentials store.
    file        Uses encrypted file-based keystore within the app's configuration directory.
                This keyring will request a password each time it is accessed, which may occur
                multiple times in a single command resulting in repeated password prompts.
    kwallet     Uses KDE Wallet Manager as a credentials management application.
    pass        Uses the pass command line utility to store and retrieve keys.
    test        Stores keys insecurely to disk. It does not prompt for a password to be unlocked
                and it should be use only for testing purposes.

kwallet and pass backends depend on external tools. Refer to their respective documentation for more
information:
    KWallet     https://github.com/KDE/kwallet
    pass        https://www.passwordstore.org/

The pass backend requires GnuPG: https://gnupg.org/

Usage:

Available Commands:
  add         Add an encrypted private key (either newly generated or recovered), encrypt it, and save to <name> file
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  delete      Delete the given keys
  export      Export private keys
  help        Help about any command
  import      Import private keys into the local keybase
  list        List all keys
  migrate     Migrate keys from amino to proto serialization format
  mnemonic    Compute the bip39 mnemonic for some input entropy
  parse       Parse address from hex to bech32 and vice versa

      --keyring-backend string   Select keyring's backend (os|file|test) (default "os")
      --keyring-dir string       The client Keyring directory; if omitted, the default 'home' directory will be used
      --node.type string         Sets key utility to use the node type's directory (e.g. ~/.celestia-light-mocha if --node.type light is passed).
      --output string            Output format (text|json) (default "text")
      --p2p.network string       Sets key utility to use the node network's directory (e.g. ~/.celestia-light-mynetwork if --node.network MyNetwork is passed). (default "mocha")
