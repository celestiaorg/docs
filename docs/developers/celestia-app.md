# Celestia App
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

This tutorial will guide you through building Celestia App. This
tutorial presumes you completed the steps in setting up your
own environment [here](./environment.mdx).

## Install Celestia App

The steps below will create a binary file named `celestia-appd`
inside `$HOME/go/bin` folder which will be used later to run the node.

```sh
cd $HOME
rm -rf celestia-app
git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app.git
cd celestia-app/
APP_VERSION=$(curl -s \
  https://api.github.com/repos/celestiaorg/celestia-app/releases/latest \
  | jq -r ".tag_name")
git checkout tags/$APP_VERSION -b $APP_VERSION
make install
```

To check if the binary was successfully compiled you can run the binary
using the `--help` flag:

```sh
celestia-appd --help
```

You should see a similar output (with helpful example commands):

```text
