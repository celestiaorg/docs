# RPC API tutorial

This tutorial will teach you how to interact with a node's RPC API.

First, [install celestia-node](../../nodes/light-node).

Initalize your node:

```bash
celestia <node_type> init --p2p.network <network>
```

Start your node:

```bash
celestia <node_type> start --p2p.network <network>
```

## cURL guide

In another terminal instance, run the following command to generate the JWT (JSON Web Token)
auth token and set it as a variable:

```bash
# make sure to add network flags if you're using a network other than the default
# auth level can be any of the following [read || write || admin]

export AUTH_TOKEN=$(celestia <node_type> auth <auth level>)
```

You'll also need the port that is exposed on your node, by default it is 26658.

To view the CLI menu:
```bash
celestia light auth -h
```

```bash
# returns the node's SamplingStats

curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$AUTH_TOKEN'' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"das.SamplingStats","params":[]}' http://localhost:26658/ | jq
```

```bash
# returns the node's chain head

curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$AUTH_TOKEN'' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"header.Head","params":[]}' http://localhost:26658/ | jq
```

## Golang guide

If you're interested in interacting with the node's API in Go,
you can use the [da-rpc-client-tutorial](https://github.com/renaynay/da-rpc-client-tutorial)
repo.
