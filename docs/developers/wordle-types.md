# Wordle Types

For the next steps, we will be creating types to be used by
the messages we created.

## Scaffolding Wordle Types

```sh
ignite scaffold map wordle word submitter --no-message
```

This type is a map called `Wordle` with two values of
`word` and `submitter`. `submitter` is the address of the
person that submitted the Wordle.

The second type is the `Guess` type. It allows us to store
the latest guess for each address that submitted a solution.

```sh
ignite scaffold map guess word submitter count --no-message
```

Here, we are also storing `count` to count how many guesses
this address submitted.
