# Contract Interaction on CosmWasm with Celestia
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

In the previous steps, we have stored out contract's tx hash in an
environment variable for later use.

Because of the longer time periods of submitting transactions via Rollmint
due to waiting on Celestia's Data Availability Layer to confirm block inclusion,
we will need to query our  tx hash directly to get information about it.

## Contract Querying

Let's start by querying our transaction hash for its code ID:

```sh
CODE_ID=$(wasmd query tx --type=hash $TX_HASH $NODE --output json | jq -r '.logs[0].events[-1].attributes[0].value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

This will give us back the Code ID of the deployed contract.

In our case, since it's the first contract deployed on our local network,
the value is `1`.

Now, we can take a look at the contracts instantiated by this Code ID:

```sh
wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID $NODE --output json
```

We get the following output:

```json
{"contracts":[],"pagination":{"next_key":null,"total":"0"}}
```

## Contract Instantiation

We start instantiating the contract by writing up the following `INIT` message
for nameservice contract. Here, we are specifying that `purchase_price` of a name
is `100uwasm` and `transfer_price` is `999uwasm`.

```sh
INIT='{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"uwasm"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"uwasm"}}'
wasmd tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "$INIT" --from $KEY_NAME --keyring-backend test --label "name service" $TXFLAG -y --no-admin
```

## Contract Interaction

Now that we instantiated it, we can interact further with the contract:

```sh
wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID $NODE --output json
CONTRACT=$(wasmd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID $NODE --output json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')
echo $CONTRACT

wasmd query wasm contract $CONTRACT $NODE
wasmd query bank balances $CONTRACT $NODE
```

This allows us to see the contract address, contract details, and
bank balances.

Now, let's register a name to the contract for our wallet address:

```sh
REGISTER='{"register":{"name":"fred"}}'
wasmd tx wasm execute $CONTRACT "$REGISTER" --amount 100uwasm --from $KEY_NAME $TXFLAG -y

# Query the owner of the name record
NAME_QUERY='{"resolve_record": {"name": "fred"}}'
wasmd query wasm contract-state smart $CONTRACT "$NAME_QUERY" $NODE --output json
```

With that, we have instantiated and interacted with the CosmWasm nameservice
smart contract using Celestia!
