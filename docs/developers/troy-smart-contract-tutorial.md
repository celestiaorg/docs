# Deploying a Smart Contract to Troy with Foundry

In this guide you'll learn how to deploy a Solidity smart contract to [Troy](/developers/troy-overview)
on Celestia with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

## About Foundry

Foundry is a portable, fast and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.

Foundry is made up of three components:

- [__Forge__](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge): Ethereum
 testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- [__Cast__](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/cast): CLI for
interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data.
- [__Anvil__](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/anvil): Local
Ethereum node, similar to Ganache or Hardhat Network.

We'll use all three to create, test, and deploy our Solidity project.

> To learn more about Foundry, check out the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

## Getting started

To deploy to Troy you will need to request tokens from the test faucet.

### Troy on Celestia Faucet

> USING THIS FAUCET DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO ANY AIRDROP OR OTHER DISTRIBUTION OF
CELESTIA OR ANY OTHER TOKENS. MAINNET CELESTIA TOKENS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST
AND THERE ARE NO PUBLIC SALES OR OTHER PUBLIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF ANY MAINNET
CELESTIA TOKENS.

You can request testnet tokens from the Celestia Troy Faucet on the
`#celestia-troy-faucet` channel on Celestia's Discord server with the
following command:

```text
$request <EVM-WALLET-ADDRESS> 
```

### Initialize development environment

First, be sure to
[install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)
on your local development environment.

Next, create a new project and change into the directory:

```sh
forge init celestia-troy-app
cd celestia-troy-app
```

Foundry has created an example smart contract located at `src/Contract.sol`.

### Updating the contract and tests

Let's update the contracts to include a basic counter example. Create a new file
in the `src` directory named `Counter.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
contract Counter {
    int private count;
    
    constructor(int _count) {
        count = _count;
    }
    function incrementCounter() public {
        count += 1;
    }
    function decrementCounter() public {
        count -= 1;
    }
    function getCount() public view returns (int) {
        return count;
    }
}
```

Next, let's create a test for this contract.

Open `test/Contract.T.Sol` and update the code with the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import 'src/Counter.sol';
contract ContractTest is Test {
    Counter counter;
    function setUp() public {
        counter = new Counter(10);
    }
    function testGetCount() public {
        int value = counter.getCount();
        assertEq(value, 10);
        emit log_int(value);
    }
    function testIncrement() public {
        counter.incrementCounter();
        counter.incrementCounter();
        int value = counter.getCount();
        assertEq(value, 12);
        emit log_int(value);
    }
    function testDecrement() public {
        counter.decrementCounter();
        int value = counter.getCount();
        assertEq(value, 9);
        emit log_int(value);
    }
}
```

Foundry uses [Dappsys Test](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/ds-test.html) to
provide basic logging and assertion functionality. It's included in the Forge
Standard Library.

Here, we are using `assertEq` to assert equality. You can view all of the assertion
functions available
[here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/ds-test.html?highlight=log_int#asserting).

Next, we can test the contract using __Forge__ with the following command:

```sh
forge test -vv
```

### Updating the deployment script

Now that we've tested the contract, let's try deploying it locally using
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html).

To do so, update the deloyment script at `script/Contracts.s.sol` with the
following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {Counter} from "src/Counter.sol";
contract ContractScript is Script {
    function setUp() public {}
    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        new Counter(10);
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

Now we can use this script to deploy our smart contract to either a live or
test network.

### Deploying locally

Next start Anvil, the local testnet:

```sh
anvil
```

Once started, Anvil will give you a local RPC endpoint as well as a handful
of Private Keys and Accounts that you can use.

We can now use the local RPC along with one of the private keys to deploy locally:

```sh
forge script script/Contract.s.sol:ContractScript --fork-url \
http://localhost:8545  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

Once the contract has been deployed locally, Anvil will log out the contract address.

Next, set the contract address as an environment variable:

```sh
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<contract-address>
```

We can then test sending transactions to it with `cast send`.

```sh
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "incrementCounter()" \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

We can then perform read operations with `cast call`:

```sh
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getCount()(int)"
```

### Deploying to Troy

Now that we've deployed and tested locally, we can deploy to Troy.

> Be sure to be using the private key for the account which holds the test
> OPC tokens requested from the faucet.
To do so, run the following script:

```sh
forge script script/Contract.s.sol:ContractScript \
--rpc-url http://35.208.160.145:8545 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

Once the contract has been deployed to Troy, we can use `cast send` to
test sending transactions to it:

```sh
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "incrementCounter()" \
--rpc-url http://35.208.160.145:8545 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY 
```

We can then perform read operations with `cast call`:

```sh
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getCount()(int)" --rpc-url http://35.208.160.145:8545
```
