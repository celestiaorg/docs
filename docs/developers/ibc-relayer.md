# IBC Relaying Guide

Celestia uses [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.dev/)
(Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol) to enable cross-chain
transfer of tokens. To support this capability it relies on
relayers, processes that can be run by anyone which constantly
scan for outbound packets on one chain and submits these packets
alongside corresponding proofs on the destination chain. This
section describes how one can setup a relayer and create new
connections between chains. There
are two standard implementations:

- [Hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/) built in Rust
- [Go Relayer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/relayer) built in Go

The following guide explains how to establish IBC connections and relay
packets between **Celestia's Blockspace Race** and **Dymension's 35-C**
networks by using the Hermes relayer.

_This guide was adapted from
[https://medium.com/qubelabs/ibc-connection-and-relaying-celestia-bsr-dymension-35-c-e4423699e856](https://medium.com/qubelabs/ibc-connection-and-relaying-celestia-bsr-dymension-35-c-e4423699e856)._

## Setup

[Hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/quick-start/) is an open-source
Rust implementation of an Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC)
relayer released as part of the `ibc-relayer-cli` crate. It includes a
CLI for relaying packets between Cosmos SDK chains, as well as Prometheus
metrics and a REST API.

### Install Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev
sudo apt install librust-openssl-dev build-essential git
```

### Build Hermes

Create a new directory and clone the Hermes repository.
For the latest available release see
[Hermes GitHub](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/tags).

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/hermes
git clone https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes
cd hermes
git checkout v1.5.0
cargo install ibc-relayer-cli --bin hermes --locked
```

Create a `keys` directory and copy the template `config.toml` to the `.hermes` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.hermes
mkdir -p $HOME/.hermes/keys
cp config.toml $HOME/.hermes
```

Before proceeding, verify that Hermes is installed correctly by running `hermes version`.

## Hermes Configuration

After you have successfully installed Hermes and created the necessary folders,
you now have to edit `config.toml` and add the appropriate configurations for
the chains you want to relay between.

For this tutorial, we will be using the following chains:

- Celestia's Blockspace Race `blockspacerace-0`
  [https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/blockspace-race/](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/blockspace-race/)

- Dymension's 35-C `35-C`
  [https://docs.dymension.xyz/validate/dymension-hub/build-dymd](https://docs.dymension.xyz/validate/dymension-hub/build-dymd)

If you are running both nodes on the same server where Hermes is running,
you can use the local host. Please adjust the ports and IPs depending
on your configurations.

```bash
nano $HOME/.hermes/config.toml
```

Please edit the Hermes configurations for your running nodes.
Do not forget to remove the `"chains"` section generated by
default with the example at the end of the file.

```bash
[[chains]]
id = 'blockspacerace-0'
rpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:26657'
grpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:9090'
websocket_addr = 'ws://127.0.0.1:26657/websocket'

rpc_timeout = '10s'
account_prefix = 'celestia'
key_name = 'hermes-celestia'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
default_gas = 5000000
max_gas = 15000000
gas_price = { price = 0.001, denom = 'utia' }
gas_multiplier = 1.1
max_msg_num = 20
max_tx_size = 209715
clock_drift = '20s'
max_block_time = '30s'
trusting_period = '21days'
trust_threshold = { numerator = '1', denominator = '3' }
memo_prefix = 'Enter your Memo'
address_type = { derivation = 'cosmos' }

[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  []
]


[[chains]]
id = '35-C'
rpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:26657'
grpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:9090'
websocket_addr = 'ws://127.0.0.1:26657/websocket'

rpc_timeout = '10s'
account_prefix = 'dym'
key_name = 'hermes-dymension'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
default_gas = 100000
max_gas = 15000000
gas_price = { price = 0.025, denom = 'udym' }
gas_multiplier = 1.1
max_msg_num = 30
max_tx_size = 2097152
clock_drift = '5s'
max_block_time = '10s'
trusting_period = '21days'
trust_threshold = { numerator = '1', denominator = '3' }
memo_prefix = 'Enter your memo'
address_type = { derivation = 'cosmos' }

[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  []
]
```

:::danger caution

Relayer needs chain data for at least 2/3 of the unbonding period,
so make sure to use pruning settings that keep the state for longer
period than the unbonding time. You can configure custom pruning in
`app.toml` for each chain.

:::

### Add relayer wallets

Now that we have successfully configured our relaying chains, we
need to import the wallets that will be used in the process. Please
note that both wallets need to be funded with the native tokens of
each chain.

You can get faucet tokens in Discord:

- Celestia: [https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity](https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity)
- Dymension: [https://discord.gg/dymension](https://discord.gg/dymension)

Add your seed phrase to a file and upload it to the server. Do not
use wallets for anything else but relaying to avoid running into
account sequence errors.

```bash
hermes keys add --chain blockspacerace-0 --mnemonic-file <seed-file>
hermes keys add --chain C-35 --mnemonic-file <seed-file>
```

### Verify configuration files

After editing `config.toml` and adding wallet keys, it’s time to
test the configurations and ensure the system is healthy. Run the following:

```bash
hermes health-check
hermes config validate
```

If everything was set up correctly, you should be seeing similar outputs:

```bash
SUCCESS performed health check for all chains in the config
SUCCESS "configuration is valid"
```

## Create a connection between 2 chains

If you’re attempting to create new connections, please **always verify first**
that the chains in question don’t already have connections and clients in
place and use the existing ones if they do. In that case you can
**skip this step** and go to [Configure channels in Hermes](#configure-channels-in-hermes)
section.

In this example, we are creating a new connection with new clients between `35-C`
and `blockspacerace-0` networks.

### Open connection over new clients

:::danger caution

If a connection already exists, do not create a new one.
Most networks already have appropriate relay paths set up!

:::

To create a new connection over new clients, use the following setup

```bash
hermes create connection --a-chain 35-C --b-chain blockspacerace-0
```

You should be seeing a similar output to this:

```bash
SUCCESS Connection {
    delay_period: 0ns,
    a_side: ConnectionSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "35-C",
                version: 0,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-22",
        ),
        connection_id: Some(
            ConnectionId(
                "connection-15",
            ),
        ),
    },
    b_side: ConnectionSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "blockspacerace-0",
                version: 0,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-0",
        ),
        connection_id: Some(
            ConnectionId(
                "connection-0",
            ),
        ),
    },
}
```

Now that the connection has been established over new clients,
we need to create a new channel, by leveraging an existing connection:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
hermes create channel --order unordered --a-chain 35-C --a-connection connection-15 --a-port  transfer --b-port transfer
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

You should be seeing a similar output to this:

```bash
SUCCESS Channel {
    ordering: Unordered,
    a_side: ChannelSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "35-C",
                version: 0,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-22",
        ),
        connection_id: ConnectionId(
            "connection-15",
        ),
        port_id: PortId(
            "transfer",
        ),
        channel_id: Some(
            ChannelId(
                "channel-14",
            ),
        ),
        version: None,
    },
    b_side: ChannelSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "blockspacerace-0",
                version: 0,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-0",
        ),
        connection_id: ConnectionId(
            "connection-0",
        ),
        port_id: PortId(
            "transfer",
        ),
        channel_id: Some(
            ChannelId(
                "channel-0",
            ),
        ),
        version: None,
    },
    connection_delay: 0ns,
}
```

:::tip Congratulations!

You have successfully created a new IBC connection between two networks.

:::

### Configure channels in Hermes

Now that we have created new connections and opened channels, we need to
edit `config.toml` again and add the newly created channels, or use the
already existing ones.

For `35-C` add:

```bash
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  ['transfer', 'channel-14'], # blockspacerace-0
]
```

For `blockspacerace-0` add:

```bash
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  ['transfer', 'channel-0'], # 35-C
]
```

## Start the relayer

To start the relayer, we will be using `systemd` as a service for
running applications as background processes.

### Create Hermes systemd file

```bash
sudo tee <<EOF >/dev/null /etc/systemd/system/hermes.service
[Unit]
Description=hermes daemon
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which hermes) start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

### Enable and start the hermes service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable hermes
sudo systemctl start hermes
```

You can follow the logs by using `sudo journalctl -u hermes.service -f`.
If the relayer is set up successfully, upon starting, you should be
seeing a similar output:

```bash
INFO ThreadId(01) spawn:chain{chain=35-C}: spawning Wallet worker: wallet::35-C
INFO ThreadId(01) spawn:chain{chain=blockspacerace-0}: spawning Wallet worker: wallet::blockspacerace-0
2023-05-12T22:51:03.193852Z  INFO ThreadId(01) Hermes has started
```

Good luck with relaying IBC packets! 🔥
