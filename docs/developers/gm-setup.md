# üíª¬†Setup

- Operating systems: GNU/Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
Recommended GNU/Linux or macOS.

> This tutorial was made on an M2 Mac with macOS Monterey Version 12.6.

- [Golang v1.18.2](https://go.dev/)
- [Ignite CLI v0.24.0](https://github.com/ignite/cli/releases/tag/v0.24.0)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

## üèÉ¬†Install Golang

Celestia-App, Celestia-Node, and Cosmos-SDK are written in the Golang
programming language. We‚Äôll need Golang to build and run them. Celestia‚Äôs
Mamaki testnet requires Golang v1.18.2 to build and run correctly.

You can [install Golang here](./environment.mdx#install-golang).

## üî•¬†Install Ignite CLI

First, you will need to create `/usr/local/bin` if you have not already:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p -m 775 /usr/local/bin
```

Run this command in your terminal to install Ignite CLI:

```bash
curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | bash
```

> ‚úã On some machines, you may run into permissions errors like the one below.
You can resolve this error by following the guidance
[here](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/install#write-permission) and below.

```bash
# Error
jcs @ ~ % curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | bash
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

######################################################################## 100.0%
**mv: rename ./ignite to /usr/local/bin/ignite: Permission denied**
============
**Error: mv failed**
jcs @ ~ %
```

The following command should resolve the permissions error:

```bash
sudo curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | sudo bash
```

A successful installation will return something similar the response below:

```bash
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

```

Verify you‚Äôve installed Ignite CLI by running:

```bash
ignite version
```
