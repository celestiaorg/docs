# Experimental Execution Environment Testnets

Over time, many different execution environments were developed for siloed L1 ecosystems. With the adoption of rollups, we want to unleash this pluralistic vision through modular blockchains enabled by Celestia.

Developers could already spin up their own local sovereign rollup on the Celestia Mamaki testnet. Now, we want to begin pushing towards a diverse experimental testnet ecosystem, enabling developers to test a large variety of execution environments implemented as rollups.

Any rollup testnets that we deploy on top of the Mamaki testnet will serve purely as an experimentation. At no point will we transition the rollup testnets to mainnet - though we hope others can launch their own rollup testnets and make the jump to Celestia mainnet!
