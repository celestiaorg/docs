## Creating a wallet

```sh
celestia-appd config keyring-backend test
```

`keyring-backend` configures the keyring's backend, where the keys are stored.

Options are: `os|file|kwallet|pass|test|memory`.

You can learn more on the [Cosmos documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/user/run-node/keyring)
or [Go Package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/crypto/keyring).

## Key management

```sh
# listing keys
celestia-appd keys list

# adding keys
celestia-appd keys add <KEY_NAME>

# deleting keys
celestia-appd keys delete <KEY_NAME>

# renaming keys
celestia-appd keys rename <CURRENT_KEY_NAME> <NEW_KEY_NAME>
```

### Importing and exporting keys

Import an encrypted and ASCII-armored private key into the local keybase.

```sh
celestia-appd keys import <KEY_NAME> <KEY_FILE>
```

Example usage:

```sh
celestia-appd keys import amanda ./keyfile.txt
```

Export a private key from the local keyring in encrypted and ASCII-armored format:

```sh
celestia-appd keys export <KEY_NAME>

# you will then be prompted to set a password for the encrypted private key:
Enter passphrase to encrypt the exported key:
```

After you set a password, your encrypted key will be displayed.

## Querying subcommands

Usage:

```sh
celestia-appd query <FLAGS> | <COMMAND>

# alias q
celestia-appd q <FLAGS> | <COMMAND>
```

To see all options:

```sh
celestia-appd q --help
```

## Token management

Get token balances:

```sh
celestia-appd q bank balances <ADDRESS> --node <NODE_URI>
```

Example usage:

```sh
celestia-appd q bank balances celestia1czpgn3hdh9sodm06d5qk23xzgpq2uyc8ggdqgw \
    --node https://rpc-mocha.pops.one:443
```

Transfer tokens from one wallet to another:

```sh
celestia-appd tx bank send <FROM_ADDRESS> <TO_ADDRESS> \
    <amount> --node <NODE_URI> --chain-id <CHAIN_ID>
```

Example usage:

```sh
celestia-appd tx bank send <FROM_ADDRESS> <TO_ADDRESS> \
    19000000utia --node https://rpc-mocha.pops.one:443 --chain-id mocha
```

To see options:

```sh
celestia-appd tx bank send --help
```

## Governance

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

Governance proposals on Celestia are limited as there are no text proposals,
upgrades occur via social consensus, and some params are not modifiable.
However, one can submit governance proposals to change certain parameters and
spend community funds. More detailed information on this topic can be found in
the [cosmos-sdk documentation for submitting
proposals](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/01_concepts.html#proposal-submission),
the list of [parameter defaults in the
specs](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/0012451c4dc118767dd59bc8d341878b7a7cacdf/specs/src/specs/params.md),
and the [x/paramfilter module
specs](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/x/paramfilter/README.md).

Viewing the available proposals can be done with the query command:

```sh
celestia-appd q gov proposals
```

There are four options when voting "yes", "no", "no_with_veto" and "abstain".
The "no_with_veto" vote is different from the "no" vote in that the submitter of
the proposer's deposit will get burned, and a minority of stake (1/3) can stop a
proposal that might otherwise pass quorum. You can use those options to vote on
a governance proposal with the following command:

```sh
celestia-appd tx gov vote <proposal id> <option> \
    --from <wallet> --chain-id <chain-id>
```

To submit a proposal, there are two commands that can be used. The first is the
legacy command, which is the recommended way to submit a proposal.

To change the max validators to 105, one would first save this JSON file:

```json
{
  "title": "Staking Param Change",
  "description": "Update max validators",
  "changes": [
    {
      "subspace": "staking",
      "key": "MaxValidators",
      "value": 105
    }
  ],
  "deposit": "1000000000utia"
}
```

Then you can submit the proposal with:

```sh
celestia-appd tx gov submit-legacy-proposal \
    parameter-change <path to json file> \
    --from <wallet> --chain-id <chain-id>
```

If we want to use the newer api, we can submit a proposal by first saving the
`sdk.Msg` proposal in the json encoded format to a json.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgSubmitProposal",
      "content": {
        "@type": "/cosmos.params.v1beta1.ParameterChangeProposal",
        "title": "title",
        "description": "description",
        "changes": [
          { "subspace": "staking", "key": "MaxValidators", "value": "103" }
        ]
      },
      "initial_deposit": [{ "denom": "utia", "amount": "1000000000" }],
      "proposer": "celestia10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700jtgz4v7"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the proposer here must be the gov module
account. That account can be found by using this command:

```sh
celestia-appd q auth module-account gov
```

Then one can submit the proposal with:

```sh
celestia-appd tx gov submit-proposal <path to json file> \
    --from <wallet> --chain-id <chain-id>
```

### Community Pool

A percentage of the block rewards are allocated to the community pool. Community
members can submit governance proposals to spend the community pool funds, and
token holders can vote on these proposals. The proposals to spend are arbitrary
in nature in that they can only contain text and some address to send funds to.
To view the community pool balance, use the following command:

```sh
celestia-appd q distribution community-pool
```

To submit a proposal to spend the community pool funds, first create a JSON file
that contains the proposal.

```json
{
  "title": "Community Pool Spend",
  "description": "Fund an open source project.",
  "recipient": "celestia17adsjkuecgjheugrdrwdqv9uh3qkrfmj9xzawx",
  "amount": "100000000000utia",
  "deposit": "1000000000utia"
}
```

The json file can be submitted using a similar proposal submission command as above:

```sh
celestia-appd tx gov submit-legacy-proposal \
    community-pool-spend <path to json file> \
    --from <wallet>
```

## Claim validator rewards

You can claim your validator rewards with
the following command:

```sh
celestia-appd tx distribution withdraw-rewards <validator valoper> \
    --commission --from=<validator wallet> --chain-id <chain-id> \
    --gas auto -y
```

## Delegate & undelegate tokens

You can `delegate` your tokens to a validator
with the following command:

```sh
celestia-appd tx staking delegate <validator valoper> <amount>\
    --from <wallet> --chain-id <chain-id>
```

You can undelegate tokens to a validator
with the `unbond` command:

```sh
celestia-appd tx staking unbond <validator valoper> <amount>\
    --from <wallet> --chain-id <chain-id>
```

## Unjailing the validator

You can unjail your validator with the
following command:

```sh
celestia-appd tx slashing unjail --from <validator wallet>\
    --chain-id <chain-id> --gas auto -y
```

## How to export logs with SystemD

You can export your logs if you are running
a SystemD service with the following command:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u <your systemd service> -S yesterday > node_logs.txt
sudo journalctl -u <your systemd service> -S today > node_logs.txt
# This command outputs the last 1 million lines!
sudo journalctl -u <your systemd service> -n 1000000 > node_logs.txt
```

## Signing genesis for a new network

You can first run the following commands:

```sh
VALIDATOR_NAME=validator1
CHAIN_ID=testnet
celestia-appd init $VALIDATOR_NAME --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
MONIKER=validator_name
```

Next create a wallet:

```sh
KEY_NAME=validator
celestia-appd keys add $KEY_NAME
```

Create or assign an EVM address:

```sh
EVM_ADDRESS=<EVM_ADDRESS>
```

Then add genesis account:

```sh
CELES_AMOUNT="5000100000000utia"
celestia-appd add-genesis-account $KEY_NAME $CELES_AMOUNT
```

Then generate your gentx:

```sh
STAKING_AMOUNT=5000000000000utia
celestia-appd gentx $KEY_NAME $STAKING_AMOUNT --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \
    --pubkey=$(celestia-appd tendermint show-validator) \
    --moniker=$MONIKER \
    --commission-rate=0.1 \
    --commission-max-rate=0.2 \
    --commission-max-change-rate=0.01 \
    --min-self-delegation=1 \
    --evm-address=$EVM_ADDRESS \
```

You can then share your gentx JSON file on
[the networks repo](https://github.com/celestiaorg/networks)
in the respective network directory you are participating in.
