# Setting up your node as a background process with SystemD

SystemD is a daemon service useful for running applications as background
processes.

## Consensus nodes

If you are running a validator or consensus node, here are
the steps to setting up `celestia-appd` as a background process.

### Start the celestia-app with SystemD

SystemD is a daemon service useful for running applications as background
processes.

Create Celestia-App systemd file:

```sh
sudo tee <<EOF >/dev/null /etc/systemd/system/celestia-appd.service
[Unit]
Description=celestia-appd Cosmos daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which celestia-appd) start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

If the file was created successfully you will be able to see its content:

```sh
cat /etc/systemd/system/celestia-appd.service
```

Enable and start `celestia-appd` daemon:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable celestia-appd
sudo systemctl start celestia-appd
```

Check if daemon has been started correctly:

```sh
sudo systemctl status celestia-appd
```

Check daemon logs in real time:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u celestia-appd.service -f
```

To check if your node is in sync before going forward:

```sh
curl -s localhost:26657/status | jq .result | jq .sync_info
```

Make sure that you have `"catching_up": false`, otherwise leave it running
until it is in sync.

## Data availability nodes

### Celestia full storage node

Create Celestia full storage node systemd file:

```sh
sudo tee <<EOF >/dev/null /etc/systemd/system/celestia-full.service
[Unit]
Description=celestia-full Cosmos daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which celestia) full start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=1400000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

If the file was created successfully you will be able to see its content:

```sh
cat /etc/systemd/system/celestia-full.service
```

Enable and start celestia-full daemon:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable celestia-full
sudo systemctl start celestia-full && sudo journalctl -u \
celestia-full.service -f
```

You should be seeing logs coming through of the full storage node syncing.

### Celestia bridge node

Create Celestia Bridge systemd file:

```sh
sudo tee <<EOF >/dev/null /etc/systemd/system/celestia-bridge.service
[Unit]
Description=celestia-bridge Cosmos daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which celestia) bridge start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=1400000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

If the file was created successfully you will be able to see its content:

```sh
cat /etc/systemd/system/celestia-bridge.service
```

Enable and start celestia-bridge daemon:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable celestia-bridge
sudo systemctl start celestia-bridge && sudo journalctl -u \
celestia-bridge.service -f
```

Now, the Celestia bridge node will start syncing headers and storing blocks
from `celestia-app`.

:::tip NOTE
At startup, we can see the `multiaddress` from Celestia bridge node.
This is **needed for future light node** connections and communication between
Celestia Bridge Nodes
:::

Example:

```sh
NODE_IP=<URI>]
/ip4/$NODE_IP/tcp/2121/p2p/12D3KooWD5wCBJXKQuDjhXFjTFMrZoysGVLtVht5hMoVbSLCbV22
```

You should be seeing logs coming through of the bridge node syncing.

### Celestia light node

Start the light node as daemon process in the background

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```sh
sudo tee <<EOF >/dev/null /etc/systemd/system/celestia-lightd.service
[Unit]
Description=celestia-lightd light node
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which celestia) light start --core.ip <URI>
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

If the file was created successfully you will be able to see its content:

```sh
cat /etc/systemd/system/celestia-lightd.service
```

Enable and start celestia-lightd daemon:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable celestia-lightd
sudo systemctl start celestia-lightd
```

Check if daemon has been started correctly:

```sh
sudo systemctl status celestia-lightd
```

Check daemon logs in real time:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u celestia-lightd.service -f
```

Now, the Celestia light node will start syncing headers.
After sync is finished, light node will do Data Availability
Sampling (DAS) from the bridge node.
