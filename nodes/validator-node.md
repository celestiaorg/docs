# Setting up a Celestia validator node

<script setup>
import constants from '/.vitepress/constants/constants.js'
</script>

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a validator node on Celestia.
Validator nodes allow you to participate in consensus in the Celestia network.

## Hardware requirements

The following hardware minimum requirements are recommended for running a
validator node:

- Memory: **8 GB RAM**
- CPU: **6 cores**
- Disk: **500 GB SSD Storage**
- Bandwidth: **1 Gbps for Download/1 Gbps for Upload**

## Setting up a validator node

The following tutorial is done on an Ubuntu Linux 20.04 (LTS) x64
instance machine.

First, follow the instructions on
[setting up a full consensus node](/nodes/full-consensus-node#setting-up-a-full-consensus-node).

### Wallet

Follow [the tutorial on creating a wallet](../nodes/celestia-app-wallet.md).

### Delegate stake to a validator

Create an environment variable for the address:

```bash
VALIDATOR_WALLET=<validator-wallet-name>
```

If you want to delegate more stake to any validator, including your own you
will need the `celesvaloper` address of the validator in question. You can run
the command below to get the `celesvaloper` of your local validator wallet in
case you want to delegate more to it:

```bash
celestia-appd keys show $VALIDATOR_WALLET --bech val -a
```

After entering the wallet passphrase you should see a similar output:

```bash
Enter keyring passphrase:
celesvaloper1q3v5cugc8cdpud87u4zwy0a74uxkk6u43cv6hd
```

To delegate tokens to the `celestiavaloper` validator, as an
example you can run:

```bash-vue
celestia-appd tx staking delegate \
celestiavaloper1q3v5cugc8cdpud87u4zwy0a74uxkk6u4q4gx4p 1000000utia \
--from=$VALIDATOR_WALLET --chain-id={{constants.mochaChainId}} \
--fees=21000utia
```

If successful, you should see a similar output as:

```console
code: 0
codespace: ""
data: ""
gas_used: "0"
gas_wanted: "0"
height: "0"
info: ""
logs: []
raw_log: '[]'
timestamp: ""
tx: null
txhash: <tx-hash>
```

You can check if the TX hash went through using the block explorer by
inputting the `txhash` ID that was returned.

## Optional: Deploy the celestia-node

Running a bridge node is critical to the Celestia network as it enables
the data availability and consensus nodes to communicate with one
another. It is recommended to support the data availability network,
but is not required for `celestia-app`.

If you are not running a bridge node, you can skip to
[run a validator node](#run-the-validator-node).

This section describes part 2 of Celestia validator node setup: running a
Celestia bridge node daemon.

### Install celestia-node

You can [follow the tutorial for installing `celestia-node`](./celestia-node.md)

### Initialize the bridge node

Run the following:

```bash
celestia bridge init --core.ip <URI>
```

:::tip
Refer to
[the ports section of the celestia-node troubleshooting page](../../nodes/celestia-node-troubleshooting/#ports)
for information on which ports are required to be open on your machine.
:::

If you need a list of RPC endpoints to connect to, you can find the
[list on the Mocha testnet page](./mocha-testnet.md#rpc-endpoints) or
[list on the Arabica devnet page](./arabica-devnet.md#rpc-endpoints).

### Run the bridge node

Run the following:

```bash
celestia bridge start
```

#### Optional: start the bridge node with SystemD

Follow
[the tutorial on setting up the bridge node as a background process with SystemD](../systemd).

You have successfully set up a bridge node that is syncing with the network.

## Run the validator node

In order to start your validator node, run the following:

```bash
celestia-appd start
```

After completing all the necessary steps, you are now ready to run a validator!
In order to create your validator onchain, follow the instructions below.
Keep in mind that these steps are necessary ONLY if you want to participate
in the consensus.

Pick a `moniker` name of your choice! This is the validator name that will show
up on public dashboards and explorers. `VALIDATOR_WALLET` must be the same you
defined previously. Parameter `--min-self-delegation=1000000` defines the
amount of tokens that are self delegated from your validator wallet.

Now, connect to the network of your choice.

You have the following option of connecting to list of networks shown below:

Continuing the validator tutorial, here are the steps to connect your
validator to Mocha:

```bash-vue
MONIKER="your_moniker"
VALIDATOR_WALLET="validator"

celestia-appd tx staking create-validator \
    --amount=1000000utia \
    --pubkey=$(celestia-appd tendermint show-validator) \
    --moniker=$MONIKER \
    --chain-id={{constants.mochaChainId}} \
    --commission-rate=0.1 \
    --commission-max-rate=0.2 \
    --commission-max-change-rate=0.01 \
    --min-self-delegation=1000000 \
    --from=$VALIDATOR_WALLET \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --fees=21000utia \
    --gas=220000
```

You will be prompted to confirm the transaction:

```console
confirm transaction before signing and broadcasting [y/N]: y
```

Inputting `y` should provide an output similar to:

```console
code: 0
codespace: ""
data: ""
gas_used: "0"
gas_wanted: "0"
height: "0"
info: ""
logs: []
raw_log: '[]'
timestamp: ""
tx: null
txhash: <tx-hash>
```

You should now be able to see your validator from
[a block explorer](./mocha-testnet.md#explorers)

## Submit your validator information

After starting your node, please submit your node as a seed and peer to the
[networks repository](https://github.com/celestiaorg/networks).

## Optional: Transaction indexer configuration options

Follow the instructions under 
[transaction indexer configuration options](/nodes/full-consensus-node#optional-transaction-indexer-configuration-options)
to configure your `config.toml` file to select which transactions to index.

## Additional resources

For additional resources, refer to
[the extra resources for consensus nodessection of the full consensus node page ](./full-consensus-node.md#extra-resources-for-consensus-nodes).
