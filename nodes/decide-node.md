# Deciding which node to run

Now that you have installed the basic dependencies,
you can start exploring which nodes to run!

## Beginner

It is highly recommended if you are a beginner to
get started with running a Data-Availability light node.

In order to get started, you can proceed to the
[light node section](./light-node.md).

You can also play around with the Data Availability API in
[this tutorial for posting and retrieving data with a light node](../developers/node-tutorial.md).

## Advanced

If you are looking to run a consensus node, please follow the
[tutorial for running a consensus node](./full-consensus-node.md).

Note that running a validator means you must also run a bridge node,
which is covered in [this section](./bridge-node.md).
