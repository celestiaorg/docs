# Blobstream for validators

[Blobstream](https://blog.celestia.org/introducing-blobstream/)
allows Ethereum developers to build high-throughput L2s using Celestia,
the first data availability layer with data availability sampling.

This page and following tutorials will go over Blobstream and how validators
on Celestia can run it.

If you're looking to learn more, you can view
[the `orchestrator-relayer` repository](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer)
or [read more about how Blobstream works](../developers/blobstream.md#overview).

## Install the Blobstream binary

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<script setup>
import constants from '/.vitepress/constants/constants.js'
import OrchRelayerVersion from '../.vitepress/components/OrchRelayerVersion.vue'
</script>

The [orchestrator](./blobstream-orchestrator.md) is the software that signs the
Blobstream attestations, and the [relayer](./blobstream-relayer.md) is the
software that relays them to the target EVM chain.

The following sections in this category presume you have the following setup:

- A celestia-app
  [validator node](./consensus-node.md#optional-setting-up-a-validator) running
- The following hardware minimum requirements for running the orchestrator:
  - Memory: **2 GB RAM**
  - CPU: **1 core**
  - Disk: **10 GB SSD Storage**

### Install

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) {{constants.golangBlobstream}}

2. Clone the `https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer` repository:

   ```bash-vue
   git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer.git
   cd orchestrator-relayer
   git checkout {{constants.orchrelayVersion}}
   ```

   These commands check you out to: <OrchRelayerVersion/>
   of @celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer

3. Install the Blobstream CLI

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

### Usage

```sh
# Print help
blobstream --help
```

### Next steps

1. If you are a Celestia validator, all you need to do is run the
   orchestrator. Check out
   [the Blobstream orchestrator page](./blobstream-orchestrator.md) for more details.
2. [Learn about key management](./blobstream-keys.md)
3. Optional: If you want to post commitments on an EVM chain, you will need to deploy
   a new Blobstream contract and run a relayer,
   or run a relayer for an already deployed Blobstream contract. Check out
   [the Blobstream relayer page](./blobstream-relayer.md) for
   relayer docs and [the Blobstream deployment page](./blobstream-deploy.md) for
   how to deploy a new Blobstream contract.
4. Optional: [Learn how to run a Blobstream bootstrapper node](./blobstream-bootstrapper.md)

:::tip
The Blobstream P2P network is a separate network than the consensus or
the data availability one. Thus, you will need its specific
bootstrappers to be able to connect to it.
