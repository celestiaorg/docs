# How to create a vesting account with celestia-app

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

In this guide, we will learn how to create a vesting account using
celestia-app for both a local devnet and on Mocha testnet.

:::tip note
The instructions for this tutorial are for a **continuous** vesting account,
if you'd like to make a delayed vesting account, just add the `--delayed`
flag to your vesting transaction.
:::

## Local devnet

First, [download and install celestia-app](../nodes/celestia-app.md),
selecting the
[network and corresponding version](../nodes/participate.md)
that you would like to use.

### Setting up the local devnet

#### Run the devnet

Next, change into the `$HOME/celestia-app` directory and
run the single-node-devnet script.

```bash
cd $HOME/celestia-app
./scripts/build-run-single-node.sh
```

#### Save the home directory path

At the top of the output, you will see a path to the "Home directory",
find yours from the output (**it will be unique every time**):

```bash
./scripts/build-run-single-node.sh
Home directory: /var/folders/_8/ljj6hspn0kn09qf9fy8kdyh40000gn/T/celestia_app_XXXXXXXXXXXXX.XV92a3qx
--> Updating go.mod
```

And set the location as the `CElESTIA_APP_HOME` variable. We will use this
for the remainder of the devnet section.

```bash
export CElESTIA_APP_HOME=/var/folders/_8/ljj6hspn0kn09qf9fy8kdyh40000gn/T/celestia_app_XXXXXXXXXXXXX.XV92a3qx
```

:::tip note
This does not replace the `celestia-appd` binary that was
installed with `celestia-appd`, but builds and runs one
in the `$HOME/celestia-app/build` directory.
:::

#### Check the version of the devnet

If you'd like to check the version of your local devnet, you can use:

```bash
cd $HOME/celestia-app/build
./celestia-appd version
```

#### Next steps

Congratulations! You now have a private devnet running locally on your machine.
The devnet is made up of one validator that is creating new blocks. This is the
Celestia consensus network on your machine! The key that was created to
run the validator also lives in a temporary directory for the devnet.

Now you are ready to test creating a vesting account on our devnet before going
to Mocha, a live testnet.

### Setting up vesting account on devnet

You already have one key setup, but you will need one more to create
a vesting account.

#### Create a new key

First, create a vesting key:

```bash
cd $HOME/celestia-app/build
./celestia-appd keys add vesting-key --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME
```

You will see the address, mnemonic, and more details about your key in the
output:

```bash
- address: celestia127fpaygehlsgjdknwvlr2mux7h5uvhkxktgkc5
  name: vesting-key
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A5JF/we+s5gFt6g944XbKVVYgQB9OY+U/l5dhZjLDczO"}'
  type: local


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

index enter egg broken ostrich duty bitter blind all car hollow coral youth early verify point void anger daring sausage decline net shove oil
```

#### List your keys

```bash
./celestia-appd keys list --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME
```

Output:

```bash
- address: celestia1adgkqcmzuxvg7x5avx8a8rjwpmxgzex3ztef6j
  name: validator
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Ahzu6yr9XMPIxLquhgBhj9xL3wIaOz6PE3CvML/oPQym"}'
  type: local
- address: celestia127fpaygehlsgjdknwvlr2mux7h5uvhkxktgkc5
  name: vesting-key
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A5JF/we+s5gFt6g944XbKVVYgQB9OY+U/l5dhZjLDczO"}'
  type: local
```

#### Set variables

Set the keys as variables, using the validator address as the `FROM_ADDRESS`
and the vesting-key as the `TO_ADDRESS`.

```bash
export FROM_ADDRESS=celestia1adgkqcmzuxvg7x5avx8a8rjwpmxgzex3ztef6j
export TO_ADDRESS=celestia127fpaygehlsgjdknwvlr2mux7h5uvhkxktgkc5
```

#### Create your devnet vesting account

Create the vesting account with the following command:

:::tip note
The remainder of the instructions are for a **continuous** vesting account,
if you'd like to make a delayed vesting account, use the `--delayed`
flag.

For example, the command to create a delayed vesting account would look like:

```bash
./celestia-appd tx vesting create-vesting-account $TO_ADDRESS 100000utia 1686748051 --from $FROM_ADDRESS --gas auto --fees 100000utia --chain-id private --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME --delayed
```

:::

```bash
./celestia-appd tx vesting create-vesting-account $TO_ADDRESS 100000utia 1686748051 --from $FROM_ADDRESS --gas auto --fees 100000utia --chain-id private --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME
```

Select "Y" to choose "yes".

:::tip Optional
If you'd like to run the command with the `-y` flag, it will
execute the transaction without needing to provide the "y" answer as above.

```bash
./celestia-appd tx vesting create-vesting-account $TO_ADDRESS 100000utia 1686748051 --from $FROM_ADDRESS --gas auto --fees 100000utia --chain-id private --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME -y
```

:::

Output:

```bash
gas estimate: 96112
auth_info:
  fee:
    amount:
    - amount: "100000"
      denom: utia
    gas_limit: "96112"
    granter: ""
    payer: ""
  signer_infos: []
  tip: null
body:
  extension_options: []

    delayed: false
    end_time: "1686748051"
    from_address: celestia1adgkqcmzuxvg7x5avx8a8rjwpmxgzex3ztef6j
    to_address: celestia127fpaygehlsgjdknwvlr2mux7h5uvhkxktgkc5

txhash: 6093DF76DBA90F04FF63D197FC1569F04ED3DBE64081A0BBA9BAD4E69AA570D2
```

The timestamp for the previous command is in the past, so once you create
the vesting account, the tokens will vest. You can check your account
balances to verify this.

#### Query the devnet vesting account details

Check that the account has been created and works as expected by querying
the `TO_ADDRESS` account details:

```bash
./celestia-appd query account $TO_ADDRESS --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME
```

In the output, you will notice that the account type is a
`ContinuousVestingAccount`:

```bash
'@type': /cosmos.vesting.v1beta1.ContinuousVestingAccount
base_vesting_account:
  base_account:
    account_number: "7"
    address: celestia127fpaygehlsgjdknwvlr2mux7h5uvhkxktgkc5
    pub_key: null
    sequence: "0"
  delegated_free: []
  delegated_vesting: []
  end_time: "1686748051"
  original_vesting:
  - amount: "100000"
    denom: utia
start_time: "1687908352"
```

#### Query the devnet base account details

Check the `FROM_ADDRESS` account details:

```bash
./celestia-appd query account $FROM_ADDRESS --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME
```

In the output, you will notice the account type is `BaseAccount`:

```bash
'@type': /cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount
account_number: "0"
address: celestia1adgkqcmzuxvg7x5avx8a8rjwpmxgzex3ztef6j
pub_key:
  '@type': /cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey
  key: Ahzu6yr9XMPIxLquhgBhj9xL3wIaOz6PE3CvML/oPQym
sequence: "2"
```

#### Query the balances of the devnet accounts

Next, we can check the balance of the accounts:

```bash
./celestia-appd query bank balances $TO_ADDRESS --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME
```

Output will show you the balance of the vesting account:

```bash
balances:
- amount: "100000"
  denom: utia
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

```bash
./celestia-appd query bank balances $FROM_ADDRESS --home $CElESTIA_APP_HOME
```

The output will show the remaining balance of the validator:

```bash
balances:
- amount: "999994999800000"
  denom: utia
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

Congratulations! You've now made your own vesting account on a local devnet.
Next, you can learn how to create a vesting account on Mocha testnet.

## Mocha

In the previous section of this tutorial, we learned how to create a vesting
account on a local devnet. In this portion of the tutorial, we'll cover how
to set up a full consensus node and set up a vesting account on
[Mocha testnet](../nodes/mocha-testnet.md).

First, be sure that you have
[installed celestia-app for the latest version for Mocha testnet](../nodes/celestia-app.md).

### Create a wallet

Set the keyring backend, so you don't need to use the flag for every command:

```bash
celestia-appd config keyring-backend test
```

Add a new key for a full node and one for a vesting account:

```bash
celestia-appd keys add origin && celestia-appd keys add vesting
```

List the keys:

```bash
celestia-appd keys list
```

Set your keys as variables:

```bash
export FROM_ADDRESS=address_of_origin_account
export TO_ADDRESS=address_of_vesting_account
```

### Fund your account

Head to [the faucet](../nodes/mocha-testnet.md#mocha-testnet-faucet),
and fund your `origin` address.

### Create a vesting account on Mocha

To create a vesting account on Mocha, you will need an RPC URL to send
the transaction to. You can find the
[RPC endpoints on the Mocha testnet page](../nodes/mocha-testnet.md#rpc-endpoints).

Set your RPC URL:

```bash
export RPC_URL=https://rpc-mocha.pops.one:443
```

We will use a few flags in our vesting command that are different than the
devnet version. Since we aren't using our own validator or full node, we will
use an RPC URL.

We also need to declare the chain ID as `mocha`.

View the help menu for vesting to understand these flags more:

```bash
celestia-appd tx vesting --help
```

Here's an example command to set up the vesting account:

```bash
celestia-appd tx vesting create-vesting-account $TO_ADDRESS 100000utia 1686748051 --from $FROM_ADDRESS --gas 100000 --fees 100000utia --node $RPC_URL --chain-id mocha --delayed
```

### Optional: Set up a full consensus node or validator

Running a full consensus node or validator will prevent you from needing
to use an RPC.

You can set up a [validator](../nodes/validator-node.md)
or [full consensus node](../nodes/full-consensus-node.md)
for the previous portion of the tutorial.

Note: this may take some time depending on how you choose to sync the
state of the chain.

### Optional: Change your client.toml

If you edit your client configuration in `client.toml`, you can set both the
chain ID and the node RPC URL. This will prevent you from needing
to run each flag for every command line that you use.

```toml
# This is a TOML config file.
# For more information, see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

###############################################################################
###                           Client Configuration                            ###
###############################################################################

# The network chain ID
chain-id = "mocha"
# The keyring's backend, where the keys are stored (os|file|kwallet|pass|test|memory)
keyring-backend = "test"
# CLI output format (text|json)
output = "text"
# <host>:<port> to Tendermint RPC interface for this chain
node = "tcp://rpc-mocha.pops.one:443"
# Transaction broadcasting mode (sync|async|block)
broadcast-mode = "sync"
```

## Notes

Not all vesting accounts can be created with a message, some need to be
set at genesis. You can
[learn more in the Cosmos Network documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/auth/05_vesting.html#note).

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to create a local devnet, create a
vesting account on it, and how to make a vesting account on the Mocha testnet!
