This guide covers how to set up a full consensus node on Celestia.
Full consensus nodes allow you to sync blockchain history in the Celestia
consensus layer.

## Hardware requirements

The following hardware minimum requirements are recommended for running a
full consensus node:

- Memory: **8 GB RAM**
- CPU: **Quad-Core**
- Disk: **250 GB SSD Storage**
- Bandwidth: **1 Gbps for Download/1 Gbps for Upload**

Running a full consensus node requires significant storage capacity to store the
entire blockchain history. As of the latest recommendation, it is advisable to
have at least 250 GB of SSD storage for a Celestia full consensus node if you
are using pruning. If you are not using pruning, you are running an archive
node, and it is recommended to have 500 GB of SSD storage. Please ensure that
your storage meets this requirement to ensure smooth syncing and operation of
the node.

## Setting up a full consensus node

The following tutorial is done on an Ubuntu Linux 20.04 (LTS) x64
instance machine.

### Set up the dependencies

Follow the instructions on [installing dependencies](./environment.md).

### Install celestia-app

Follow the tutorial on [installing `celestia-app`](./celestia-app.md).

### Set up the P2P networks

Now we will set up the P2P Networks by cloning the networks repository:

```sh
cd $HOME
rm -rf networks
git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/networks.git
```

To initialize the network, pick a "node-name" that describes your
node. Keep in mind that this might change if a new testnet is deployed.

::: code-group

```bash-vue [Mainnet Beta]
celestia-appd init "node-name" --chain-id {{constants.mainnetChainId}}
```

```bash-vue [Mocha]
celestia-appd init "node-name" --chain-id {{constants.mochaChainId}}
```

```bash-vue [Arabica]
celestia-appd init "node-name" --chain-id {{constants.arabicaChainId}}
```

:::

Download the `genesis.json` file:

::: code-group

```bash-vue [Mainnet Beta]
celestia-appd download-genesis {{constants.mainnetChainId}}
```

```bash-vue [Mocha]
celestia-appd download-genesis {{constants.mochaChainId}}
```

```bash-vue [Arabica]
celestia-appd download-genesis {{constants.arabicaChainId}}
```

:::

Set seeds in the `$HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml` file:

::: code-group

```bash-vue [Mainnet Beta]
SEEDS=$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celestiaorg/networks/master/{{constants.mainnetChainId}}/seeds.txt | tr '\n' ',')
echo $SEEDS
sed -i.bak -e "s/^seeds *=.*/seeds = \"$SEEDS\"/" $HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml
```

```bash-vue [Mocha]
SEEDS=$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celestiaorg/networks/master/{{constants.mochaChainId}}/seeds.txt | tr '\n' ',')
echo $SEEDS
sed -i.bak -e "s/^seeds *=.*/seeds = \"$SEEDS\"/" $HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml
```

```bash-vue [Arabica]
# For Arabica, you can set seeds manually in the
# `$HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml` file:
# Comma separated list of seed nodes to connect to
seeds = ""
```

:::

**Optionally**, you can set persistent peers in your `config.toml` file.
You can get the persistent peers from the networks repository with
the following commands:

Setting persistent peers is advised only if you are running a sentry node.

::: code-group

```bash-vue [Mainnet Beta]
PERSISTENT_PEERS=$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celestiaorg/networks/master/{{constants.mainnetChainId}}/peers.txt | tr '\n' ',')
echo $PERSISTENT_PEERS
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PERSISTENT_PEERS\"/" $HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml
```

```bash-vue [Mocha]
PERSISTENT_PEERS=$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celestiaorg/networks/master/{{constants.mochaChainId}}/peers.txt | tr '\n' ',')
echo $PERSISTENT_PEERS
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PERSISTENT_PEERS\"/" $HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml
```

```bash-vue [Arabica]
PERSISTENT_PEERS=$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celestiaorg/networks/master/{{constants.arabicaChainId}}/peers.txt | tr '\n' ',')
echo $PERSISTENT_PEERS
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PERSISTENT_PEERS\"/" $HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml
```

## Storage and pruning configurations

### Connecting a consensus node to a bridge node

If your consensus node is being connected to a celestia-node bridge node,
you will need to enable transaction indexing and retain all block
data. This can be achieved with the following settings in your `config.toml`.

#### Enable transaction indexing

```toml
indexer = "kv"
```

#### Retain all block data

And in your `app.toml`, `min-retain-blocks` should remain as the default
setting of `0`:

```toml
min-retain-blocks = 0 # retain all block data, this is default setting
```

### Querying transactions by hash

To query transactions using their hash, transaction
indexing must be turned on. Set the `indexer` to `"kv"` in your `config.toml`:

```toml
indexer = "kv"
```

### Accessing historical state

If you want to query the historical state — for example, you might want
to know the balance of a Celestia wallet at a given height in the past —
you should run an archive node with `pruning = "nothing"` in your `app.toml`.
Note that this configuration is resource-intensive and will require
significant storage:

```toml
pruning = "nothing"
```

### Saving on storage requirements

If you want to save on storage requirements, consider using
`pruning = "everything"` in your `app.toml` to prune everything. If you
select `"everything"` or `"default"`, but still want to keep the block data,
you can do so by not changing the default value of
`min-retain-blocks = 0` in your `app.toml`. A value of `0` for
`min-retain-blocks` will keep all block data. This will prune snapshots of
the state, but it will keep block data:

```toml
pruning = "everything"
min-retain-blocks = 0 # this is the default setting
```

## Syncing

By default, a consensus node will sync using block sync; that is request, validate
and execute every block up to the head of the blockchain. This is the most secure
mechanism yet the slowest (taking up to days depending on the height of the blockchain).

There are two alternatives for quicker syncing.

### State sync

State sync uses light client verification to verify state snapshots from peers
and then apply them. State sync relies on weak subjectivity; a trusted header
(specifically the hash and height) must be provided. This can be found by querying
a trusted RPC endpoint (/block). RPC endpoints are also required for retrieving
light blocks. These can be found in the docs here under the respective networks or
from [the chain-registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry).

In `$HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml`, set

```toml
rpc_servers = ""
trust_height = 0
trust_hash = ""
```

To their respective fields. At least two different rpc endpoints should be provided.
The more, the greater the chance of detecting any fraudulent behavior.

Once setup, you should be ready to start the node as normal. In the logs, you should
see: `Discovering snapshots`. This may take a few minutes before snapshots are found
depending on the network topology.

### Quick sync

Quick sync effectively downloads the entire `data` directory from a third-party provider
meaning the node has all the application and blockchain state as the node it was
copied from.

Run the following command to quick-sync from a snapshot:

::: code-group

```bash-vue [Mainnet Beta]
cd $HOME
rm -rf ~/.celestia-app/data
mkdir -p ~/.celestia-app/data
SNAP_NAME=$(curl -s https://snaps.qubelabs.io/celestia/ | \
    egrep -o ">{{constants.mainnetChainId}}.*tar" | tr -d ">")
aria2c -x 16 -s 16 -o celestia-snap.tar "https://snaps.qubelabs.io/celestia/${SNAP_NAME}"
tar xf celestia-snap.tar -C ~/.celestia-app/data/
```

```bash-vue [Mocha]
cd $HOME
rm -rf ~/.celestia-app/data
mkdir -p ~/.celestia-app/data
SNAP_NAME=$(curl -s https://snaps.qubelabs.io/celestia/ | \
    egrep -o ">{{constants.mochaChainId}}.*tar" | tr -d ">")
aria2c -x 16 -s 16 -o celestia-snap.tar "https://snaps.qubelabs.io/celestia/${SNAP_NAME}"
tar xf celestia-snap.tar -C ~/.celestia-app/data/
```

```bash-vue [Arabica]
cd $HOME
rm -rf ~/.celestia-app/data
mkdir -p ~/.celestia-app/data
SNAP_NAME=$(curl -s https://snaps.qubelabs.io/celestia/ | \
    egrep -o ">{{constants.arabicaChainId}}.*tar" | tr -d ">")
aria2c -x 16 -s 16 -o celestia-snap.tar "https://snaps.qubelabs.io/celestia/${SNAP_NAME}"
tar xf celestia-snap.tar -C ~/.celestia-app/data/
```

## Start the consensus node

In order to start your full consensus node, run the following:

```sh
celestia-appd start
```

Optional: If you would like celestia-app to run as a background process, you can follow the [SystemD tutorial](./systemd.md).

:::tip
Refer to
[the ports section of the celestia-node troubleshooting page](../nodes/celestia-node-troubleshooting.md#ports)
for information on which ports are required to be open on your machine.
:::

## Extra resources for consensus nodes

### Optional: Reset network

This will delete all data folders so we can start fresh:

```sh
celestia-appd tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home $HOME/.celestia-app
```

### Optional: Configuring an RPC endpoint

You can configure your full consensus node to be a public RPC endpoint.
This allows it to accept connections from data availability nodes and
serve requests for the data availability API.

#### Expose RPC

By default, the RPC service listens on `localhost` which means it can't
be accessed from other machines. To make the RPC service available publicly,
you need to bind it to a public IP or `0.0.0.0` (which means listening on all
available network interfaces).

You can do this by editing the config.toml file:

```sh
sed -i 's#"tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"#"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"#g' ~/.celestia-app/config/config.toml
```

This command replaces the `localhost` IP address with `0.0.0.0`, making the
RPC service listen on all available network interfaces.

#### Note on `external-address`

The `external-address` field in the configuration is used when your node
is behind a NAT and you need to advertise a different address for peers
to dial. Populating this field is not necessary for making the RPC
endpoint public.

```sh
EXTERNAL-ADDRESS=$(wget -qO- eth0.me)
sed -i.bak -e "s/^external-address = ""/external-address = "$EXTERNAL-ADDRESS:26656"/" \
    $HOME/.celestia-app/config/config.toml
```

#### Restart the node

After making these changes, restart `celestia-appd` to load the new
configurations.

### Optional: Transaction indexer configuration options

This section guides you on how to configure your `config.toml`
file in `celestia-app` to select which transactions to index.
Depending on the application's configuration, a node operator
may decide which transactions to index.

The available options are:

1. `null`: This option disables indexing. If you don't need to
   query transactions, you can choose this option to save space.
2. `kv` (default): This is the simplest indexer, backed by
   key-value storage (defaults to levelDB; see DBBackend).
   When `kv` is chosen, `tx.height` and `tx.hash` will always be
   indexed. This option is suitable for basic queries on transactions.
3. `psql`: This indexer is backed by PostgreSQL. When psql is chosen,
   `tx.height` and `tx.hash` will always be indexed. This option is
   suitable for complex queries on transactions.

An example to set the value to `kv` in `config.toml` is:

```toml
indexer = "kv"
```

Remember to restart `celestia-appd` after making changes to the
configuration to load the new settings.

### Optional: Discard ABCI responses configuration

This section will guide you on how to configure your `config.toml` file in
`celestia-app` to manage the storage of ABCI responses. ABCI responses are
the results of executing transactions and are used for `/block_results` RPC
queries and to reindex events in the command-line tool.

The `discard_abci_responses` option allows you to control whether these
responses are persisted in the state store:

- `false` (default): ABCI responses are stored in the state store. This
  ensures that ABCI responses are available for `/block_results` RPC queries
  and for reindexing events. However, it can consume a significant amount
  of disk space.
- `true`: ABCI responses are not stored in the state store. This can
  save a considerable amount of disk space, but `/block_results` RPC queries
  and event reindexing will not be available.

An example to set the value to false in `config.toml` is:

```toml
discard_abci_responses = false
```

Remember to restart `celestia-appd` after making changes to the
configuration to load the new settings.
