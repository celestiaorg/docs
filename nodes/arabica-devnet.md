# Arabica devnet

![arabica-devnet](/img/arabica-devnet.png)

Arabica devnet is a testnet from Celestia Labs that is focused
exclusively on providing developers with enhanced performance and
the latest upgrades for testing their rollups and applications.

Arabica does not focus on validator or consensus-level testing, rather,
that is what Mocha testnet is used for. If you are a validator, we
recommend testing your validator operations on the
[Mocha testnet](./mocha-testnet.md).

## Network stability and upgrades

Arabica has the latest updates from all Celestia's products deployed
on it, it can be subject to many changes. Therefore, as a fair warning,
Arabica can break unexpectedly, but given it will be continuously updated,
it is a useful way to keep testing the latest changes in the software.

Developers can still deploy on Mocha testnet their sovereign rollups if they
chose to do so, it just will always lag behind Arabica devnet until Mocha
undergoes Hardfork Upgrades in coordination with Validators.

## Integrations

This guide contains the relevant sections for how to connect to Arabica
devnet, depending on the type of node you are running. Your best
approach to participating is to first determine which node you would
like to run. Each node’s guide will link to the relevant network in
order to show you how to connect to them. Learn about the different
endpoint types [in the Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/grpc_rest).

### Using consensus endpoints with DA nodes

Consensus RPC endpoints are used to provide DA nodes with state access for
querying the chain’s state and broadcasting transactions (balances, blobs,
etc.) to the Celestia network.

Developers will need to provide a
`–core.ip string` from a consensus node’s URI or an IP that populates
2 ports for 2 types (RPC and gRPC, at ports 26657 and 9090, respectively)
to their respective DA node.

:::tip EXAMPLE

```bash
celestia <da_type> start –core.ip <url> –core.rpc.port <port> \
    –core.grpc.port <port> \
```

:::

RPCs for DA nodes to initialise or start your celestia-node to
Arabica devnet with can be found in the table in the
"Direct endpoints with open ports" section above.

As an example, this command will work to start a light node with
state access, using default ports:

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network arabica \
  --core.ip validator-1.celestia-arabica-11.com
```

:::tip Bridge node runners
Not all of the RPC endpoints do not guarantee the full block history.
Find [an archive endpoint on the community dashboard](https://celestia-tools.brightlystake.com/)
or run your own full consensus node with no pruning for
your bridge node.
