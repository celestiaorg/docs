# Mainnet Beta

![Mainnet Beta](/img/Mainnet-Beta.png)

Welcome to the guide for Celestia's Mainnet Beta.
Mainnet Beta is the culmination of rigorous community testing,
upgrades, and feedback. It serves as the platform for deploying
Mainnet Beta rollups and unstoppable applications.

## Network stability and upgrades

Mainnet Beta is a stable network, but will still receive updates and
improvements. Any changes or upgrades will be coordinated with node
operators and the broader Celestia community to ensure seamless
integration and minimal service interruptions.

As we step into unexplored territories with groundbreaking technologies
like data availability sampling, it's crucial to remember that Mainnet
Beta remains experimental at this stage. While the network is live and
functional, users may encounter occasional instability or reduced performance.

## Network status

For real-time network status information, including uptime, incident reports,
and service availability, visit the
[official Celestia Mainnet status page](https://status.celestia.dev/status/mainnet).

## Network parameters

### Transaction size limit

The maximum transaction size on all networks is 8 MiB (8,388,608 bytes). See [CIP-38](https://cips.celestia.org/cip-038.html) which activated at [the v6 upgrade height](/operate/maintenance/network-upgrades#matcha-network-upgrade).

Previously, in [CIP-28](https://cips.celestia.org/cip-028.html), there was a 2 MiB limit on transaction size. This limit was implemented to maintain network stability and provide clear expectations for users and developers, even as block sizes may be larger.

### Block size limit

While individual transactions are limited to 8 MiB as of v6, a block can contain multiple transactions and has a much larger capacity. The maximum block size is determined by the effective maximum square size.

The current max square size on Arabica is 128 MiB, Mocha is 32 MiB, and Mainnet is 8 MiB.

The following provides an approximation of the maximum blob capacity on Arabica:

- The maximum square size is 512x512, which gives us 262,144 shares.
- One share is reserved for the PFB transaction, leaving us with 262,143 shares available for blob data.
- The first sparse share has 478 bytes available, and the remaining sparse shares have 482 bytes each.

Approximate capacity:

```
First share:       1 x 478 bytes
Remaining shares:  262,142 x 482 bytes
Total bytes:       126,352,922 bytes
```

There is no precise, static upper bound on the maximum total
blob size. It depends on several factors:

- The maximum square size, which is determined by a governance parameter
  and a versioned constant.
- The maximum bytes in a block, which is determined by a governance parameter
  and a hard-coded constant in CometBFT.
- The number of shares occupied by the PFB transaction share.

These factors can cause the maximum total blob size that can be included in one
block to vary.

See the code in
[celestia-app](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/52a3cfadbf4439e5e1bd89a8c47e14d3209ca525/pkg/appconsts/initial_consts.go#L9).

can be found in the
[celestia-app specifications](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/parameters_v6.html).

## Integrations

This guide contains the relevant sections for how to connect to Mainnet Beta,
depending on the type of node you are running. Your best approach to
participating is to first [determine which node you would like to run](/operate/getting-started/overview). Each
node's guide will link to the relevant network in order to show you how
to connect to them. Learn about the different endpoint types
[in the Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/grpc_rest).

### Production RPC endpoints

These RPC providers are meant to be used in production environments
and for specific use cases that require reliable access to full block
history, such as:

- Running Bridge Nodes that download data from core RPC endpoints
- Applications that need Bridge Node endpoints with guaranteed uptime and SLAs
- Submitting blobs in production settings (free RPC endpoints have no guarantees, even for submitting transactions)

| Provider  | URL                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

see [the light node guide](/operate/data-availability/light-node/advanced#optional-start-light-node-with-consensus-endpoint-authentication)
to learn how to use an endpoint with x-token.

### Node setup and tools

Several community providers offer comprehensive node setup tools, installation scripts, and monitoring services to help node operators get started quickly:

### Community consensus endpoints

> **Warning:** Do not rely on the free community endpoints listed below for production deployments. Production deployments should rely on [service providers with SLAs](#production-rpc-endpoints).

You can also find the list of official Celestia bootstrappers in the [celestia-node GitHub repository](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/blob/a87a17557223d88231b56d323d22ac9da31871db/nodebuilder/p2p/bootstrap.go#L39).

The following table lists community-provided consensus node endpoints that you can use:

### Connecting DA nodes to consensus nodes

Data availability (DA) nodes need to connect to consensus nodes to sync blocks and access state. When starting a DA node, you'll need to provide a consensus node endpoint using the `--core.ip` parameter and the port.

You can use any of the RPC endpoints from the [community consensus endpoints](#community-consensus-endpoints) table above. The default port is 9090, where gRPC is used for both block sync and state access.

For example, to connect to the P-OPS endpoint:

```bash
celestia light start --core.ip rpc.celestia.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

### Bridge node requirements

Not all RPC endpoints guarantee the full block history.
Bridge nodes require access to the full historical block data, so you should use an archive endpoint to run your bridge node.

Check the [production endpoints](#production-rpc-endpoints) or the [community dashboard](https://celestia-tools.brightlystake.com/) to identify which endpoints are archive nodes with full historical data.

Alternatively, you can run your own consensus node with no pruning for your bridge node.

### Archival DA RPC endpoints

By default, light nodes prune recent data to save on storage space. Archival
data availability (DA) nodes store the entire history of the chain without
pruning any data so all data available data is retrievable. You can
[read more about light vs archival nodes](/learn/celestia-101/retrievability/).

## Community endpoint status dashboard

To check the current status, uptime, and health of all community endpoints, visit the [RPC stats for Celestia dashboard](https://celestia-tools.brightlystake.com/). This dashboard provides real-time information about:

- Which endpoints are currently online
- Response times and performance metrics
- Which endpoints are archive nodes with full historical data
- Last seen heights for each endpoint

This is an essential resource when selecting endpoints for your nodes or applications.
