# Overview to running nodes on Celestia

There are many ways you can participate in the Celestia
[networks](/operate/networks/overview).

Celestia node operators can run several options on the network.

Consensus:

- [Validator node](/operate/consensus-validators/validator-node):
  This type of node participates
  in consensus by producing and voting on blocks.
- [Consensus node](/operate/consensus-validators/consensus-node): A celestia-app full node
  to sync blockchain history.

Data Availability:

- [Bridge node](/operate/data-availability/bridge-node): This node bridges blocks between the
  Data-Availability network and the Consensus network.
- [Light node](/operate/data-availability/light-node/quickstart): Light clients conduct data availability
  sampling on the Data Availability network.

You can learn more about how to set up each different node by going through
each tutorial guide. If you want to get hands-on with a light node right away, follow the quickstart in the Build section: [Post/retrieve a blob → Light node quickstart](/operate/data-availability/light-node/quickstart/).

Please provide any feedback on the tutorials and guides. If you notice
a bug or issue, feel free to make a pull request or write up a Github
issue!
