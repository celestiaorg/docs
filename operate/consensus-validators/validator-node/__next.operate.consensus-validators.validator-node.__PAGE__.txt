# Setting up a Celestia validator node

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a validator node on Celestia.
Validator nodes allow you to participate in consensus in the Celestia network.

![validator node](/img/nodes/validator.png)

## Hardware requirements

See [hardware requirements](/operate/getting-started/hardware-requirements).

## Setting up a validator node

The following tutorial is done on an Ubuntu Linux 20.04 (LTS) x64
instance machine.

First, follow the instructions on
[setting up a consensus node](/operate/consensus-validators/consensus-node#set-up-a-consensus-node).

### Wallet

Follow [the tutorial on creating a wallet](/operate/keys-wallets/celestia-app-wallet).

## Optional: Deploy the celestia-node

Running a bridge node is critical to the Celestia network as it enables
the data availability and consensus nodes to communicate with one
another. It is recommended to support the data availability network,
but is not required.

If you are not running a bridge node, you can skip to
[run a validator node](#run-the-validator-node).

This section describes part 2 of Celestia validator node setup: running a
Celestia bridge node daemon.

### Install celestia-node

You can [follow the tutorial for installing `celestia-node`](/operate/data-availability/install-celestia-node)

### Initialize the bridge node

Run the following:

```bash
celestia bridge init --core.ip <URI> --core.port <port>
```

<Callout type="info">
Refer to [the ports section of the celestia-node troubleshooting page](/operate/maintenance/troubleshooting#ports) for information on which ports are required to be open on your machine.
</Callout>

When connecting your bridge node to a localhost consensus node, ensure that gRPC
is properly configured in your consensus node's `app.toml` file. The `[grpc]`
section should have `enable = true` and the appropriate address setting for the
bridge node to connect successfully.

Using an RPC of your own, or one from
[Mainnet Beta](/operate/networks/mainnet-beta#integrations),
[Mocha testnet](/operate/networks/mocha-testnet#rpc-for-da-bridge-full-and-light-nodes) or
[Arabica devnet](/operate/networks/arabica-devnet#integrations),
initialize your node.

### Run the bridge node

Run the following:

```bash
celestia bridge start
```

#### Optional: start the bridge node with SystemD

Follow
[the tutorial on setting up the bridge node as a background process with SystemD](/operate/maintenance/systemd).

You have successfully set up a bridge node that is syncing with the network.

## Run the validator node

In order to create a validator on-chain, follow the steps below.

1. Start the consensus node

   ```sh
   celestia-appd start
   ```

1. Export an environment variable for the chain ID you want to run on:

   <Tabs items={['Mainnet Beta', 'Mocha', 'Arabica']}>
     <Tabs.Tab>
       ```bash
       export CHAIN_ID={{constants['mainnetChainId']}}
       ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
     <Tabs.Tab>
       ```bash
       export CHAIN_ID={{constants['mochaChainId']}}
       ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
     <Tabs.Tab>
       ```bash
       export CHAIN_ID={{constants['arabicaChainId']}}
       ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
   </Tabs>

1. Export more environment variables.

   ```bash
   # Pick a moniker name of your choice.
   export MONIKER="your_moniker"

   # Set VALIDATOR_WALLET to the same you defined previously.
   export VALIDATOR_WALLET="validator"

   # Set VALIDATOR_PUBKEY to the pubkey of your validator wallet.
   export VALIDATOR_PUBKEY=$(celestia-appd tendermint show-validator)
   ```

1. If you want to create a validator on a testnet that is on app version 4 (currently only Arabica), you will need to create a `validator.json` file.

   **Arabica:**
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF > validator.json
   {
     "pubkey": $VALIDATOR_PUBKEY,
     "amount": "1000000utia",
     "moniker": "$MONIKER",
     "commission-rate": "0.1",
     "commission-max-rate": "0.2",
     "commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
     "min-self-delegation": "1"
   }
   EOF
   ```

1. Create a validator

   <Tabs items={['Mainnet Beta', 'Mocha', 'Arabica']}>
     <Tabs.Tab>
       ```bash
       celestia-appd tx staking create-validator \
           --amount=1000000utia \
           --pubkey=$VALIDATOR_PUBKEY \
           --moniker=$MONIKER \
           --identity=<optional_identity_signature> \
           --website="<optional_validator_website>" \
           --security-contact="<optional_email_address_for_security_contact>" \
           --details="A short and optional description of the validator." \
           --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID \
           --commission-rate=0.1 \
           --commission-max-rate=0.2 \
           --commission-max-change-rate=0.01 \
           --min-self-delegation=1000000 \
           --from=$VALIDATOR_WALLET \
           --keyring-backend=test \
           --fees=21000utia \
           --gas=220000 \
           --yes
       ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
     <Tabs.Tab>
       ```bash
       celestia-appd tx staking create-validator \
           --amount=1000000utia \
           --pubkey=$VALIDATOR_PUBKEY \
           --moniker=$MONIKER \
           --identity=<optional_identity_signature> \
           --website="<optional_validator_website>" \
           --security-contact="<optional_email_address_for_security_contact>" \
           --details="A short and optional description of the validator." \
           --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID \
           --commission-rate=0.1 \
           --commission-max-rate=0.2 \
           --commission-max-change-rate=0.01 \
           --min-self-delegation=1000000 \
           --from=$VALIDATOR_WALLET \
           --keyring-backend=test \
           --fees=21000utia \
           --gas=220000 \
           --yes
       ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
     <Tabs.Tab>
       ```bash
       celestia-appd tx staking create-validator validator.json \
           --from $VALIDATOR_WALLET \
           --keyring-backend test \
           --fees 21000utia \
           --gas=220000 \
           --yes
       ```
     </Tabs.Tab>
   </Tabs>

You should see output like:

```console
code: 0
codespace: ""
data: ""
gas_used: "0"
gas_wanted: "0"
height: "0"
info: ""
logs: []
raw_log: '[]'
timestamp: ""
tx: null
txhash: <tx-hash>
```

> **Note:** The options `--identity`, `--website`, `--security-contact` and `--details` are optional. The `--identity` value is used to verify identity with systems like [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) or UPort. If you need to add or update the values of these descriptive fields when your validator is already created, you can use the following command (remove the options that you don't want to change the values for):

```bash
celestia-appd tx staking edit-validator \
    --new-moniker=<new_validator_name> \
    --identity=<identity_signature> \
    --website="<validator_website>" \
    --security-contact="<email_address_for_security_contact>" \
    --details="New description of the validator." \
    --from=$VALIDATOR_WALLET \
    --keyring-backend=test \
    --fees=21000utia \
    --gas=220000
```


You should now be able to see your validator from a [block explorer](/operate/networks/mocha-testnet#explorers).

## Submit your validator information

After starting your node, please submit your node as a seed and peer to the
[networks repository](https://github.com/celestiaorg/networks).

## Optional: Delegate stake to a validator

Create an environment variable for the address:

```bash
VALIDATOR_WALLET=<validator-wallet-name>
```

If you want to delegate more stake to any validator, including your own you
will need the `celestiavaloper` address of the validator in question. You can run
the command below to get the `celestiavaloper` of your local validator wallet in
case you want to delegate more to it:

```bash
celestia-appd keys show $VALIDATOR_WALLET --bech val -a
```

After entering the wallet passphrase you should see a similar output:

```bash
Enter keyring passphrase:
celestiavaloper1q3v5cugc8cdpud87u4zwy0a74uxkk6u43cv6hd
```

To delegate tokens to the `celestiavaloper` validator, as an
example you can run:

```bash
celestia-appd tx staking delegate \
<the_valoper_address_starts_with_celestiavaloper1...> 1000000utia \
--from=$VALIDATOR_WALLET --chain-id={{constants['mochaChainId']}} \
--fees=21000utia
```

If successful, you should see a similar output as:

```console
code: 0
codespace: ""
data: ""
gas_used: "0"
gas_wanted: "0"
height: "0"
info: ""
logs: []
raw_log: '[]'
timestamp: ""
tx: null
txhash: <tx-hash>
```

You can check if the TX hash went through using the block explorer by
inputting the `txhash` ID that was returned.

## Optional: Transaction indexer configuration options

Follow the instructions under
[transaction indexer configuration options](/operate/consensus-validators/consensus-node#optional-transaction-indexer-configuration-options)
to configure your `config.toml` file to select which transactions to index.

## Migrating a validator to another machine

> **Warning:** Moving a validator to a new machine is a sensitive process that needs to be done carefully. If the transfer isn’t handled properly, it could result in double signing, which will permanently slash your validator, wipe out delegated tokens, and remove you from the active validator set. To avoid this, make sure to follow the steps closely and stop the old node completely before starting the migration.

### Step 1: Set up a new full consensus node

First, set up a new [consensus node](/operate/consensus-validators/consensus-node) on the new server and make sure the node is fully synced with the chain. To check whether your node is synced, you can check the `catching_up` status using:

```bash
celestia-appd status | jq '{ "catching_up": .SyncInfo.catching_up }'
```

If the node is synced, the output will look like this:

```json
{
  "catching_up": false
}
```

### Step 2: Stop the old validator

After your new consensus node is synced, proceed to stop the current validator on the old machine. If you’re running it with [SystemD](/operate/maintenance/systemd), use the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop <SERVICE_NAME>
```

Additionally, it’s recommended to disable the service to prevent it from restarting automatically after a system reboot. You can do this with:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable <SERVICE_NAME>
```

For extra safety, you may also delete the service file from the server:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/<SERVICE_NAME>.service
```

### Step 3: Backup and transfer `priv_validator_key.json`

Once the old validator is stopped and the new node is synced, you’ll need to back up the `priv_validator_key.json` file from the old server (if it has not been backed up earlier). This file is located at:

```plaintext
~/.celestia-app/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

Copy this file to the same location on the new server. To verify that the file has been transferred correctly, compare its contents on both servers using:

```bash
cat ~/.celestia-app/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

### Step 4: Start the new validator

If everything checks out, you can now restart the new node with the updated validator key:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart <SERVICE_NAME>
```

After this, your validator will resume signing blocks on the new server, and the migration is complete. Validators operate within a 10,000 signed block window, and missing more than 2,500 blocks in this window will result in downtime jail. The faster you complete the transfer, the fewer blocks your validator will miss.

### `+2/3 committed an invalid block: wrong Block.Header.Version`

If you encounter an error like:

```bash
2024-04-25 14:48:24 6:48PM ERR CONSENSUS FAILURE!!! err="+2/3 committed an invalid block: wrong Block.Header.Version.

```

then it is likely that the network has upgraded to a new app version but your consensus node was not prepared for the upgrade. To fix this, you'll need to update your binary to the latest version and restart your node with the relevant `--v2-upgrade-height` for the network you're running on. If your node still can't sync to the tip of the chain after the above steps, consider a `celestia-appd tendermint reset-state` to reset your node and start syncing from the genesis block.

1. [Optional] Back up your validator keys.
1. [Optional] Back up the `data/priv_validator_state.json` inside your CELESTIA_HOME directory.
1. Remove DBs from your CELESTIA_HOME directory via: `celestia-appd tendermint reset-state`.
1. Remove the `data/application.db` inside your CELESTIA_HOME directory.
1. Download the latest binary for your network.
1. Restart your consensus node with the relevant `--v2-upgrade-height` for the network you're running on.

### `App cannot be started without CometBFT when using the multiplexer`

If you encounter an error like:

```bash
2025-11-13 14:48:24 6:48PM ERR App cannot be started without CometBFT when using the multiplexer.
```

It is possible that one of the historical celestia-app binaries you have downloaded is a multiplexer binary. To resolve you can remove all historical binaries:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.celestia-app/bin
```

Re-download all historical binaries:

```bash
make download-v3-binaries download-v4-binaries download-v5-binaries
```

### `ERR failed to LoadFinalizeBlockResponse err="node is not persisting finalize block responses"`

If you encounter an error like:

```bash
ERR failed to LoadFinalizeBlockResponse err="node is not persisting finalize block responses" module=rpc
```

Then the RPC node you are querying is not persisting finalize block responses. To resolve, you can query a node that _does_ persist finalize block responses.

If you run the node, you can modify the `config.toml` to set `discard_abci_responses = false`:

```toml
[storage]

# Set to true to discard ABCI responses from the state store, which can save a
# considerable amount of disk space. Set to false to ensure ABCI responses are
# persisted. ABCI responses are required for /block_results RPC queries, and to
# reindex events in the command-line tool.
