# Advanced

This page collects advanced topics for Celestia light nodes. For
setup and blob posting, see
[Getting started](/operate/data-availability/light-node/quickstart).

---

## Start light node with consensus endpoint authentication

If the consensus node gRPC endpoint you connect to requires authentication, pass
a directory containing `xtoken.json`:

```bash
celestia light start \
  --core.ip snowy-methodical-leaf.celestia-mainnet.quiknode.pro \
  --core.tls \
  --core.xtoken.path /path-to-directory \
  --core.port 9090
```

Where `/path-to-directory` contains `xtoken.json` (recommended: `chmod 600`):

```json
{
  "x-token": "<YOUR-SECRET-X-TOKEN>"
}
```

---

## Run the light node with a custom key

To use a non-default key, make sure the key exists in your node store and pass
`--keyring.keyname` on `start`:

<Callout type="info">
For key creation, backup, import/recover, and Docker setups, see
[Create a wallet with celestia-node](/operate/keys-wallets/celestia-node-key).
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Mainnet Beta', 'Mocha', 'Arabica']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    celestia light start --core.ip <URI> --core.port <port> \
      --keyring.keyname <name-of-custom-key>
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    celestia light start --core.ip <URI> --core.port <port> \
      --keyring.keyname <name-of-custom-key> --p2p.network mocha
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

      --keyring.keyname <name-of-custom-key> --p2p.network arabica
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Run the light node with SystemD

Follow the tutorial for running Celestia Node as a background process with
SystemD:
[/operate/maintenance/systemd#celestia-light-node](/operate/maintenance/systemd#celestia-light-node).

---

## Fast sync with a trusted hash

Setting and syncing to a trusted height and hash means your light node will not
sample the entire chain from genesis. This is useful when you want to sync your
light node quickly.

<Callout type="warning">
This adds the trust assumption that you trust the source of the height and
hash.
</Callout>

Celestia also supports initializing from a trusted hash via
[trusted hash recovery](/operate/maintenance/trusted-hash-recovery).

<Steps>

### Get a trusted height and hash

This example uses the P-OPS Mocha endpoint:

```bash
read -r TRUSTED_HEIGHT TRUSTED_HASH <<<"$(curl -s https://rpc-mocha.pops.one/header | jq -r '.result.header | "\(.height) \(.last_block_id.hash)"')" && export TRUSTED_HEIGHT TRUSTED_HASH
```

### Set `SyncFromHeight` and `SyncFromHash`

Edit your config file at `~/.celestia-light-{{constants['mochaChainId']}}/config.toml` and set:

```toml
SyncFromHeight = 123456
SyncFromHash = "E8BD0C48260C496BB7A4D8D1E7BDBF1F26A2FE3CF5714DECE1741B2FFB3C095C"
```

Ensure `SyncFromHash` has **no `0x` prefix**.

### Start the node

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

</Steps>

---

## High throughput transaction submission

Celestia supports three transaction submission modes that affect how
transactions are queued and submitted, impacting throughput and ordering
guarantees. These modes are controlled by the `TxWorkerAccounts` setting in your
light node's `config.toml` file.

### Default mode (TxWorkerAccounts = 0)

This is the default behavior. Transactions are submitted immediately without a
queue.

**Characteristics:**

- Transactions enter the mempool immediately
- No queuing or waiting for confirmations
- Potential sequence number conflicts if submitting multiple transactions quickly
- Same behavior as versions prior to v0.28.2

### Queued mode (TxWorkerAccounts = 1)

Enable synchronous, ordered submission by setting `TxWorkerAccounts` to `1` in
your `config.toml`.

<Steps>

#### Open your config file

```bash
nano ~/.celestia-light-{{constants['mochaChainId']}}/config.toml
```

#### Set TxWorkerAccounts to 1

Find the `[SubmitClient]` section and add or update:

```toml
[SubmitClient]
TxWorkerAccounts = 1
```

#### Restart your node

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

</Steps>

**Characteristics:**

- Each transaction queues until the previous one is confirmed
- Preserves strict ordering of transactions based on submission time
- Avoids sequence mismatch errors
- Throughput: approximately 1 PayForBlobs transaction every other block

**Use case:** Applications requiring strict transaction ordering

### Parallel mode (TxWorkerAccounts > 1)

For high-throughput applications that don't require sequential ordering, enable
parallel submission by setting `TxWorkerAccounts` to a value greater than 1.

<Steps>

#### Open your config file

```bash
nano ~/.celestia-light-{{constants['mochaChainId']}}/config.toml
```

#### Set TxWorkerAccounts to desired number of lanes

Find the `[SubmitClient]` section and add or update:

```toml
[SubmitClient]
TxWorkerAccounts = 8
```

#### Restart your node

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

</Steps>

**How it works:**

- Creates `TxWorkerAccounts` parallel submission lanes
- Each lane is a subaccount automatically created and funded from your default account
- Example: `TxWorkerAccounts = 8` creates 7 subaccounts + 1 default account = 8 parallel lanes
- Enables at least 8 PayForBlobs transactions per block

**Characteristics:**

- Transactions can be submitted concurrently across multiple lanes
- Does NOT guarantee transaction ordering
- Blobs may be included in blocks in a different order than submitted
- Higher throughput for applications that can handle unordered transactions

**Use case:** High-throughput, unordered workflows

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** When retrieving blobs submitted in parallel mode, you must
  track the height, namespace, and commitment for each blob submission, as you
  won't know which subaccount was used.
</Callout>

**Subaccount management:**

- Subaccounts are automatically created and funded from your default account
- They are named `parallel-worker-1`, `parallel-worker-2`, etc. in your keyring
- Subaccounts are reused across node restarts if `TxWorkerAccounts` value remains the same
- If you decrease `TxWorkerAccounts`, only the first N workers are used
- If you increase `TxWorkerAccounts`, additional workers are created

### Comparison table

| Mode     | TxWorkerAccounts | Ordering       | Throughput       | Use case                                 |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Default  | 0                | Not guaranteed | Immediate        | Simple applications, single transactions |
| Queued   | 1                | Guaranteed     | ~1 tx per block  | Applications requiring strict ordering   |
| Parallel | >1               | Not guaranteed | ≥N txs per block | High-throughput, unordered workflows     |

---

## Node store contents

The node store is created during `celestia light init` and lives under
`~/.celestia-<node-type>-<network>`.

For example, a Mocha light node store at `~/.celestia-light-{{constants['mochaChainId']}}` contains:

- `config.toml`: Node configuration settings
- `data/`: Database files
- `keys/`: Node identity and account keys

---

## Get your auth token

Your auth token is useful when you want to interact with your Celestia light
node from another machine or a client application. Generate an admin token with:

```bash
celestia light auth admin --p2p.network mocha
```

Each time you run this, you will receive a new token. It's not possible to
revoke tokens once they are issued.

Use `celestia light auth --help` to learn more about the available options.

---

## Find your node ID

Your node ID is your libp2p peer ID. You’ll need it when creating multiaddrs
(for example, `.../p2p/<node-ID>`).

While your node is running, run:

```bash
celestia p2p info
```

See also `p2p.Info` in the [celestia-node API docs](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#p2p.Info).

---

## Migrate node ID to another server

If you want the new machine to keep the same node identity, back up the
identity material from your node store (for example, the `keys/` directory under
`~/.celestia-light-<network>/`) and restore it on the new machine before
starting the node.

---

## Pruning windows

If you need data older than your current pruning windows, use
`SyncFromHeight`/`SyncFromHash` to re-sync from an earlier point in time.

- Sampling window: 7 days ([v0.25.3 release notes](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/releases/tag/v0.25.3))
- Header pruning window: 14 days ([v0.26.4 release notes](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/releases/tag/v0.26.4))

---

## Advanced key management with `cel-key`

For key management beyond the built-in capabilities of the light node, use the
separate `cel-key` utility. This dedicated tool allows you to create, import,
and manage keys, and to select which key your node uses.
