# Learn

Welcome to the Learn section of Celestia documentation. Here you'll find comprehensive guides to understand how Celestia works.

## What is Celestia?

Celestia is a modular blockchain network that enables anyone to easily deploy their own blockchain, without the overhead of bootstrapping a new consensus network.

## Key Concepts

- **Modular Architecture**: Separate execution from consensus and data availability
- **Data Availability Sampling**: Light nodes can verify data availability without downloading all data
- **Sovereign Rollups**: Deploy your own blockchain with custom execution logic
