title: Math & LaTeX
---

You can write LaTeX math directly in MDX. Inline formulas use single dollar signs: `Einstein noted $E = mc^2$.`

$$
E = mc^2
$$

For display equations, wrap the math in double dollar signs on their own lines:

$$
\oint_C \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = - \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
$$

Aligned expressions work with standard LaTeX environments:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\
\nabla \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Tips:

- Use a single backslash inside math (`\alpha`, `\frac{1}{2}`); MDX math blocks don’t need double escaping.
- Keep math blocks separated from surrounding text with blank lines for reliable rendering.
