# Private data availability on Celestia

Private data availability (PDA) lets apps post **encrypted** state to Celestia while proving it’s **valid and available**. You get privacy **and** auditability — ideal for institutional use.

* zkVM encrypts data + proves correctness
* Celestia stores ciphertext with DA guarantees
* Anyone can verify availability without seeing plaintext
* Supports selective disclosure, user-controlled keys, safe exits

Use it for private exchanges, payments, RWAs, backups, and cross-chain encrypted messaging.
