# Private blockspace

Private blockspace lets you post **encrypted** data to Celestia while proving it's **valid and available**. You get confidentiality and verifiability, which is ideal for institutional applications that need both privacy and compliance.

## How it works

A lightweight proxy sits between your app and Celestia:

1. **Submit**: The proxy encrypts your data, generates a zkVM proof, and posts to Celestia
2. **Retrieve**: The proxy fetches and decrypts blobs using your encryption key
3. **Verify**: Anyone can verify availability and correctness without seeing plaintext

## Use cases

- **Confidential exchanges**: Private order books with provable solvency ([Hibachi](https://hibachi.xyz/))
- **Confidential payments**: Encrypted transactions with regulatory compliance
- **RWA tokenization**: Private holder data with verifiable state
- **Private backups**: Encrypted recovery without exposing plaintext
- **Cross-chain messaging**: Verifiable encrypted data transport
