# Optional: Diving deeper into the stack

This section covers some more in-depth topics that you may find useful when working with your Celestia light node.

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Node store contents

Elaborating on the [initialize the node store](#initialize-the-node-store) section above, the node store is created in the `~/.celestia-<node-type>-<network>` directory.

In this guide, the node store for `~/.celestia-light-mocha-4` contains the following directories and file types:

- `config.toml`: Node configuration settings
- `data/`: Contains database files
  - `.vlog` files: Value log files storing actual data
  - `.sst` files: Static sorted tables containing indexed data
  - System files: `DISCARD`, `KEYREGISTRY`, and `MANIFEST` for database management
- `keys/`: Stores node identity and account keys
  - Contains encoded node identifiers
  - `keyring-test/`: Test keyring directory
    - `.address` files: Account addresses
    - `.info` files: Key metadata and information

## Get your auth token

Your auth token may be useful when you want to interact with your Celestia light node from a client application. You can get your auth token by running:

```bash
celestia light auth admin --p2p.network mocha
```

Each time you run this, you will receive a new token. It's not possible to revoke tokens once they are issued.

Use `celestia light auth --help` to learn more about the available options.

## Advanced key management with `cel-key`

For more advanced key management beyond the built-in capabilities of the light node, use the separate `cel-key` utility. This dedicated tool allows you to:

- Create, import, and manage keys.
- Backup, verify and select the active key used by your node

To utilize `cel-key`, you'll need to build it separately from the binary with `make cel-key`.

# Advanced, high throughput

## Parallel tx submission

1. parallel transaction submission: https://github.com/celestiaorg/docs/issues/2273 - different accounts. must track height, namespace, commitment

## Queued tx submission

1. queued transaction submission https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/98bb2ab0de430f59e2c2664524cacb3f71974562/specs/src/tx_client.md

## Pruning windows

if you want data older than the pruning window, you can use the SyncFromHash = "" and SyncFromHeight = "" in config.toml

Sampling window is 7 days as per release notes https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/releases/tag/v0.25.3
Header pruning window is 14 days as per release notes https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/releases/tag/v0.26.4

## Set a trusted height and hash

This allows you to retain data from a specific height and hash.

If you're using multiple light nodes for similar services like tracking the same rollup, it is recommended to use the same hash and height for all services using the same starting height.

<Steps>

### Initialize the node store (if not done already)

```
celestia light init --p2p.network mocha
```

### Get and set the trusted height and hash

```
# Get both the height and hash values in a single call
read -r TRUSTED_HEIGHT TRUSTED_HASH <<<"$(curl -s https://rpc-mocha.pops.one/header | jq -r '.result.header | "\(.height) \(.last_block_id.hash)"')" && export TRUSTED_HEIGHT TRUSTED_HASH

# Use sed to find and replace the SyncFromHeight value in the config file (macOS version)
sed -i '' "s/SyncFromHeight = .*/SyncFromHeight = $TRUSTED_HEIGHT/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml

# Add/update the SyncFromHash value
sed -i '' "s/SyncFromHash = .*/SyncFromHash = \"$TRUSTED_HASH\"/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml

# Display the updated values to confirm
echo "SyncFromHeight updated to: $TRUSTED_HEIGHT"
echo "SyncFromHash updated to: $TRUSTED_HASH"
```

### Start the node

```
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

<Callout>
For Linux users, remove the empty string (`''`) after `-i` in the `sed` commands:

```
sed -i "s/SyncFromHeight = .*/SyncFromHeight = $TRUSTED_HEIGHT/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml
sed -i "s/SyncFromHash = .*/SyncFromHash = \"$TRUSTED_HASH\"/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml
```
</Callout>

</Steps>
