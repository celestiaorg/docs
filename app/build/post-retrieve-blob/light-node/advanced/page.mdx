# Optional: Diving deeper into the stack

This section covers some more in-depth topics that you may find useful when working with your Celestia light node.

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Node store contents

Elaborating on the [initialize the node store](#initialize-the-node-store) section above, the node store is created in the `~/.celestia-<node-type>-<network>` directory.

In this guide, the node store for `~/.celestia-light-mocha-4` contains the following directories and file types:

- `config.toml`: Node configuration settings
- `data/`: Contains database files
  - `.vlog` files: Value log files storing actual data
  - `.sst` files: Static sorted tables containing indexed data
  - System files: `DISCARD`, `KEYREGISTRY`, and `MANIFEST` for database management
- `keys/`: Stores node identity and account keys
  - Contains encoded node identifiers
  - `keyring-test/`: Test keyring directory
    - `.address` files: Account addresses
    - `.info` files: Key metadata and information

## Get your auth token

Your auth token may be useful when you want to interact with your Celestia light node from a client application. You can get your auth token by running:

```bash
celestia light auth admin --p2p.network mocha
```

Each time you run this, you will receive a new token. It's not possible to revoke tokens once they are issued.

Use `celestia light auth --help` to learn more about the available options.

## Advanced key management with `cel-key`

For more advanced key management beyond the built-in capabilities of the light node, use the separate `cel-key` utility. This dedicated tool allows you to:

- Create, import, and manage keys.
- Backup, verify and select the active key used by your node

To utilize `cel-key`, you'll need to build it separately from the binary with `make cel-key`.

## Advanced: High throughput transaction submission

Celestia supports three transaction submission modes that affect how transactions are queued and submitted, impacting throughput and ordering guarantees. These modes are controlled by the `TxWorkerAccounts` setting in your light node's `config.toml` file.

### Default mode (TxWorkerAccounts = 0)

This is the default behavior. Transactions are submitted immediately without a queue.

**Characteristics:**
- Transactions enter the mempool immediately
- No queuing or waiting for confirmations
- Potential sequence number conflicts if submitting multiple transactions quickly
- Same behavior as versions prior to v0.28.2

### Queued mode (TxWorkerAccounts = 1)

Enable synchronous, ordered submission by setting `TxWorkerAccounts` to `1` in your `config.toml`.

<Steps>

#### Open your config file

```bash
nano ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml
```

#### Set TxWorkerAccounts to 1

Find the `[SubmitClient]` section and add or update:

```toml
[SubmitClient]
TxWorkerAccounts = 1
```

#### Restart your node

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

</Steps>

**Characteristics:**
- Each transaction queues until the previous one is confirmed
- Preserves strict ordering of transactions based on submission time
- Avoids sequence mismatch errors
- Throughput: approximately 1 PayForBlobs transaction every other block

**Use case:** Applications requiring strict transaction ordering

### Parallel mode (TxWorkerAccounts > 1)

For high-throughput applications that don't require sequential ordering, enable parallel submission by setting `TxWorkerAccounts` to a value greater than 1.

<Steps>

#### Open your config file

```bash
nano ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml
```

#### Set TxWorkerAccounts to desired number of lanes

Find the `[SubmitClient]` section and add or update:

```toml
[SubmitClient]
TxWorkerAccounts = 8
```

#### Restart your node

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

</Steps>

**How it works:**
- Creates `TxWorkerAccounts` parallel submission lanes
- Each lane is a subaccount automatically created and funded from your default account
- Example: `TxWorkerAccounts = 8` creates 7 subaccounts + 1 default account = 8 parallel lanes
- Enables at least 8 PayForBlobs transactions per block

**Characteristics:**
- Transactions can be submitted concurrently across multiple lanes
- Does NOT guarantee transaction ordering
- Blobs may be included in blocks in a different order than submitted
- Higher throughput for applications that can handle unordered transactions

**Use case:** High-throughput, unordered workflows

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** When retrieving blobs submitted in parallel mode, you must track the height, namespace, and commitment for each blob submission, as you won't know which subaccount was used.
</Callout>

**Subaccount management:**
- Subaccounts are automatically created and funded from your default account
- They are named `parallel-worker-1`, `parallel-worker-2`, etc. in your keyring
- Subaccounts are reused across node restarts if `TxWorkerAccounts` value remains the same
- If you decrease `TxWorkerAccounts`, only the first N workers are used
- If you increase `TxWorkerAccounts`, additional workers are created

### Comparison table

| Mode     | TxWorkerAccounts | Ordering       | Throughput       | Use case                                 |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Default  | 0                | Not guaranteed | Immediate        | Simple applications, single transactions |
| Queued   | 1                | Guaranteed     | ~1 tx per block  | Applications requiring strict ordering   |
| Parallel | >1               | Not guaranteed | ≥N txs per block | High-throughput, unordered workflows     |

## Pruning windows

if you want data older than the pruning window, you can use the SyncFromHash = "" and SyncFromHeight = "" in config.toml

Sampling window is 7 days as per release notes https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/releases/tag/v0.25.3
Header pruning window is 14 days as per release notes https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/releases/tag/v0.26.4

## Set a trusted height and hash

This allows you to retain data from a specific height and hash.

If you're using multiple light nodes for similar services like tracking the same rollup, it is recommended to use the same hash and height for all services using the same starting height.

<Steps>

### Initialize the node store (if not done already)

```
celestia light init --p2p.network mocha
```

### Get and set the trusted height and hash

```
# Get both the height and hash values in a single call
read -r TRUSTED_HEIGHT TRUSTED_HASH <<<"$(curl -s https://rpc-mocha.pops.one/header | jq -r '.result.header | "\(.height) \(.last_block_id.hash)"')" && export TRUSTED_HEIGHT TRUSTED_HASH

# Use sed to find and replace the SyncFromHeight value in the config file (macOS version)
sed -i '' "s/SyncFromHeight = .*/SyncFromHeight = $TRUSTED_HEIGHT/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml

# Add/update the SyncFromHash value
sed -i '' "s/SyncFromHash = .*/SyncFromHash = \"$TRUSTED_HASH\"/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml

# Display the updated values to confirm
echo "SyncFromHeight updated to: $TRUSTED_HEIGHT"
echo "SyncFromHash updated to: $TRUSTED_HASH"
```

### Start the node

```
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one --core.port 9090
```

<Callout>
For Linux users, remove the empty string (`''`) after `-i` in the `sed` commands:

```
sed -i "s/SyncFromHeight = .*/SyncFromHeight = $TRUSTED_HEIGHT/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml
sed -i "s/SyncFromHash = .*/SyncFromHash = \"$TRUSTED_HASH\"/" ~/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml
```
</Callout>

</Steps>
