# Local OP Stack devnet

This guide will teach you how to spin up a complete local OP Stack rollup with Celestia DA for testing.

:::tip Coming Soon
The "Build the bundle generator" and "Generate the pre-deployed bundle" steps will soon be available through the Popkins UI.
:::

```bash
# Build the bundle generator (coming soon to Popkins UI)
cd control-plane/cmd/pop-deployer
go build -o pop-deployer .

# Generate the pre-deployed bundle (coming soon to Popkins UI)
./pop-deployer

# Extract and run
tar xzf opstack-local-devnet-bundle.tar.gz
cd bundle
docker compose up -d
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
cast block-number --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
# 55
```

This starts:
- **Anvil** - L1 chain with pre-deployed OP Stack contracts
- **OP-Geth** - L2 execution client
- **OP-Node** - L2 consensus/derivation
- **Localestia** - Mock Celestia DA layer
- **POPSigner-Lite** - Local signing service

The bundle comes with all contracts already deployed and configured - just extract and run.

**What `pop-deployer` does:** It spins up a temporary Anvil instance, deploys all OP Stack contracts (SystemConfig, L1CrossDomainMessenger, OptimismPortal, etc.), captures the chain state to a snapshot, then packages everything into a tarball. When you run the bundle, Anvil loads the pre-deployed state instantly - no waiting for contract deployments.
