# Local Nitro devnet

This guide will teach you how to spin up a complete local Arbitrum Nitro rollup with Celestia DA for testing.

**What `pop-deployer` does:** It spins up a temporary Anvil instance, deploys all Nitro infrastructure contracts (`RollupCreator`, `Bridge`, `SequencerInbox`, `Outbox`, challenge manager, one-step provers, etc.), creates the rollup via `createRollup`, deploys WETH for BOLD staking, captures the chain state to a snapshot, then packages everything into a tarball. When you run the bundle, Anvil loads the pre-deployed state instantly - no waiting for contract deployments.

    The "Build the bundle generator" and "Generate the pre-deployed bundle" steps will soon be available through the Popkins UI.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Build the bundle generator (coming soon to Popkins UI)

```bash
cd control-plane/cmd/pop-deployer
go build -o pop-deployer .
```

### Generate the pre-deployed bundle (coming soon to Popkins UI)

```bash
./pop-deployer --stack nitro
```

### Extract and run

The bundle comes with all contracts already deployed and configured - just extract and run.

```bash
tar xzf nitro-local-devnet-bundle.tar.gz
cd bundle
./scripts/start.sh
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
cast chain-id --rpc-url http://localhost:8547
# 42069
```

This starts:
- **Anvil** - L1 chain with pre-deployed Nitro contracts (RollupCreator, Bridge, SequencerInbox, Outbox, etc.)
- **Nitro Sequencer** - L2 execution and sequencing (nitro-node)
- **Localestia** - Mock Celestia DA layer
- **POPSigner-Lite** - Local signing service

</Steps>
