# Blobstream: Streaming modular DA to Ethereum

![Blobstream logo](/img/blobstream/blobstream_logo.png)

## What is Blobstream?

[Blobstream](https://blog.celestia.org/introducing-blobstream/)
is the first data availability solution for Ethereum that securely
scales with the number of users. Formerly known as the [Quantum Gravity Bridge (QGB)](https://blog.celestia.org/celestiums/),
Blobstream relays commitments to Celestia's data root to an onchain light client
on Ethereum, for integration by developers into L2 contracts. This enables Ethereum
developers to build high-throughput L2s using Celestia's optimised DA layer,
the first with Data Availability Sampling (DAS). Any ecosystem can deploy a
Blobstream light client onchain to allow L2s and L3s to access DA from Celestia.

An implementation of Blobstream, by [Succinct](https://platform-docs.succinct.xyz/), called
[Blobstream X](https://github.com/succinctlabs/blobstreamx), is out
and will be used in the upcoming deployments. This implementation proves the
validity of Celestia block headers on a target EVM chain using zero-knowledge (ZK)
proofs, which allow inheriting all the security
guarantees of Celestia.

The latest implementation of Blobstream X is [SP1 Blobstream](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-blobstream), 
which is written in Rust for the SP1 zkVM. SP1 Blobstream offers improved performance and 
efficiency while maintaining the security guarantees of the original Blobstream X.

Please note: Blobstream remains early-stage, experimental software and
users should use Blobstream at their own risk.

## Blobstream vs. data availability committees (DACs)

### Decentralization and security

Blobstream is built on Celestia, which uses a CometBFT-based proof-of-stake
system. Blobstream shares the same security assumptions
as Celestia. In contrast, data availability committees (DACs), are typically
centralized or semi-centralized, relying on a specific set of entities or
individuals to vouch for data availability.

### Mechanism of verification

Blobstream uses data availability attestations, which are Merkle roots of
the batched L2 data, to confirm that the necessary data is present on Celestia.
The L2 contract on Ethereum can check directly with Blobstream if the data
is published on Celestia. Similarly, a DAC would rely on
attestations or confirmations from its permissioned members.

### Flexibility and scalability

Blobstream is designed to offer high-throughput data availability for Ethereum
L2s, aiming to strike a balance between scalability and security. It operates
independently of Ethereum's gas costs, as Celestia's resource pricing is more
byte-focused rather than computation-centric. On the other hand, the scalability
and flexibility of a DAC would depend on its specific design and implementation.

In summary, both Blobstream and DACs aim to ensure offchain data availability,
but Blobstream offers a more decentralized, secure, and scalable solution
compared to the potential centralized nature of DACs.

## What is SP1 Blobstream?

[SP1 Blobstream](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-blobstream) is the latest implementation of Blobstream
in Rust using the [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) zkVM.

[SP1 Blobstream](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-blobstream) is the latest implementation of Blobstream with a
ZK light client that bridges Celestia’s modular DA layer to
Ethereum to allow high-throughput rollups to use Celestia’s DA while settling
on Ethereum.

Optimistic or ZK rollups that settle on Ethereum, but wish to use Celestia for
DA, require a mechanism for _bridging_ Celestia’s data root to Ethereum as part
of the settlement process. This data root is used during inclusion proofs to
prove that particular rollup transactions were included and made available in
the Celestia network.

Bridging Celestia’s data root to Ethereum requires running a Celestia
_light client_ as a smart contract on Ethereum, to make the latest state
of the Celestia chain known on Ethereum and available to rollups. SP1 Blobstream
uses the latest advances in ZK proofs to generate a
_succinct proof_ that enough Celestia validators have come to consensus
(according to the CometBFT consensus protocol) on a block header, and
verifies this proof in the SP1 Blobstream Ethereum smart contract to update
it with the latest Celestia header.

The SP1 Blobstream ZK proof not only verifies the consensus of
Celestia validators, but it also merkelizes and hashes all the data roots
in the block range from the previous update to the current update, making
accessible all Celestia data roots (verifiable with a Merkle inclusion proof
against the stored Merkle root) to rollups.

If you're looking to deploy SP1 blobstream to a new chain,
see [new Sp1 Blobstream deployments](./sp1-blobstream-deploy.md).

repo.

The current Blobstream deployments all use SP1 Blobstream.

## Integrate with SP1 Blobstream

The following docs go over how developers can integrate SP1 Blobstream.

You can [find the repository for SP1 Blobstream](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-blobstream)
along with code for:

- [The SP1 Blobstream smart contract - `SP1Blobstream.sol`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-blobstream/blob/main/contracts/src/SP1Blobstream.sol)
- [The SP1 program](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-blobstream/tree/main/program)
- [The SP1 Blobstream contract Golang bindings](//TODO)

The first deployments of SP1 Blobstream will be maintained on the
following chains: Arbitrum One, Base and Ethereum Mainnet. Every 1
hour, the prover/relayer will post an update to the Blobstream contract
that will include a new data commitment range that covers a 1-hour
block range from the `latestBlock` in the contract.
On Ethereum Mainnet, the contract will be updated
every 4 hours.

### How to integrate with Blobstream

Integrating your L2 with Blobstream requires two components: your
[onchain smart contract logic](./blobstream-contracts.md),
and your [offchain client logic for your rollup](./blobstream-offchain.md).
The next three sections cover these
topics:

- [Integrate with Blobstream contracts](./blobstream-contracts.md)
- [Integrate with Blobstream client](./blobstream-offchain.md)
- [Querying the Blobstream proofs](./blobstream-proof-queries.md)

### Blobstream rollups

More on the different ways to build a blobstream rollup can be found in the
[blobstream rollups](./blobstream-rollups.md) documentation.

### Deployed contracts

You can interact with the SP1 Blobstream contracts today. The
SP1 Blobstream Solidity smart contracts are currently deployed on
the following chains:
