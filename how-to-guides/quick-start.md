# Quick start guide

In this section, we show you how to get started
with installing the needed libraries and packages
in Celestia to help you run a node on Celestia.

## Celestia Node

[Install celestia-node](./celestia-node.md) allows you to get started with
running a light node and do data availability sampling.

Light nodes are the best nodes to test out initially if
you are new to participating in Celestia.

celestia-node client also allows you to run other types
of data availability (DA) nodes like bridge and full DA storage
nodes, which will be covered in later sections.

## Celestia App

[Install celestia-app](./celestia-app.md) allows you to get started
running a consensus node.

celestia-app is the software that allows you to run
validator nodes and also provide RPC endpoints.

celestia-app covers the consensus layer, while celestia-node
covers the DA layer.

## Getting started

As covered in the previous section, Celestia offers
two different test networks, [Arabica devnet](./arabica-devnet.md)
and [Mocha testnet](./mocha-testnet.md).

If you are planning to run a light node, it is recommended
to use Arabica, which you will find options to connecting to
in the later sections.

If you plan on running a validator, your only option is to run
your node on Mocha.

In this quick start guide, we will go over installing both of
the software clients: celestia-node and celestia-app.

:::tip NOTE
If you just want to run a light node, you don't need to
install celestia-app and can skip that part.
