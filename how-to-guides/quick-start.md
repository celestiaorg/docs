Welcome to Celestia's quick start guide! In this guide, we'll learn how to run a Celestia data availability sampling (DAS) light node to post and retrieve data blobs on Celestia's [Mocha testnet](./mocha-testnet.md).

A blob (a.k.a. [BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage#Origins)) is a Binary Large OBject. In other words, a blob is arbitrary data. In this case, it's data that you want to post and make available on Celestia's data availability (DA) layer.

Your light node will allow you to post data, and then use DAS to sample and retrieve it from the DA network. Let's get started!

## Run a light node

First we'll need to install the `celestia` binary to run our DAS light node. Use the following command to install a pre-built binary of [celestia-node](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node), for the latest release on Mocha testnet:

> For this guide, select either your Go bin or system bin directory when prompted. If you're curious what [the script](https://github.com/celestiaorg/docs/tree/main/public/celestia-node.sh) is doing, check out [the celestia-node page](./celestia-node.md#installing-a-pre-built-binary).

```bash-vue
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://docs.celestia.org/celestia-node.sh)" -- -v {{mochaVersions['node-latest-tag']}}
```

Once you've installed `celestia`, double-check that you're using the right version by running:

```bash
celestia version
```

You should see the version of the binary that you just installed. Use `celestia --help` to see the CLI menu.

### Initialize the light node

Initializing your light node will set up configuration files and create a keypair for your node.

The `p2p.network` flag is used to specify the network you want to connect to. Use `mocha` for Mocha testnet.

> The chain ID `{{ constants.mochaChainId }}` is also an accepted alias.

```bash
celestia light init --p2p.network mocha
```

Once you've run this command, you'll see a new keypair that's created in your terminal. Be sure to save your mnemonic somewhere safe for future use!

```bash
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:31	Initializing Light Node Store over '/Users/js/.celestia-light-mocha-4'
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:64	Saved config	{"path": "/Users/js/.celestia-light-mocha-4/config.toml"}
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:66	Accessing keyring...
WARN	node	nodebuilder/init.go:196	Detected plaintext keyring backend. For elevated security properties, consider using the `file` keyring backend.
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:211	NO KEY FOUND IN STORE, GENERATING NEW KEY...	{"path": "/Users/js/.celestia-light-mocha-4/keys"}

MNEMONIC (save this somewhere safe!!!):
never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you never gonna make you cry never gonna

INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:73	Node Store initialized
```

You'll also see In this example, using the Mocha testnet and setting up a light node, our node store will be at: `~/.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}`.

> Logs above have the timestamps removed for brevity. And yes, that's a Rickroll mnemonic. ðŸ˜œ

### Start the light node

Run the following command to start your light node:

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one
```

The `core.ip` flag is used to specify the consensus RPC endpoint's you want to connect to. We'll use `rpc-mocha.pops.one` from the [P-OPS team](https://pops.one) for Mocha testnet.

Once you see this in the logs, you're ready to start posting data!

```bash-vue
/_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/

Started celestia DA node
node version: 	{{mochaVersions['node-latest-tag'].slice(1)}}
node type: 	light
network: 	{{ constants.mochaChainId }}

/_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/
```

## Post and retrieve data with your light node

### Funding your light node

Now, we're almost ready to start posting data!

Open a second terminal instance for the remainder of this guide. Let's find our address for the node we have running by running:

```bash
celestia state account-address
```

Take this account address and head over to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity) and request tokens from the `#mocha-faucet` channel.

Once you've requested tokens, can check the balance using:

```bash
celestia state balance
```

### Posting data

Now that you have tokens in your account, you can post data to the network. Let's break down the arguments you'll provide to the CLI:

```bash
celestia blob submit [namespace] [blobData]
```

The `[namespace]` is a permissionless way to categorize your data on Celestia. In other words, it's a channel for you to post your data. For example, this could be the name of your project or a category for the type of blob. In this example, we'll use `0x48656C6C6F` as the namespace, which is the hex encoding of "quotes".

> [Learn more about namespaces in celestia-app documentation](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/namespace.html).

The `[blobData]` is the blob data you want to post to the network. In this example, we'll use a quote from Leonardo da Vinci:

```bash
celestia blob submit 0x48656C6C6F '"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." -Leonardo da Vinci'
```

Once you run this command, you'll see a a height and data committment in the response. This means your data has been successfully posted to the network!

```bash
{
  "result": {
    "height": 2983850,
    "commitments": [
      "0x6e2b64874f7daca3d61c3302ecff5634d9ac0a01d58b4b41417c4e1cacd26a9a"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Retrieving data

To retrieve the data you posted, use the following command:

```bash
celestia blob get [height] [namespace] [committment]
```

In this example, you'll use the height and commitment from the response above:

```bash
celestia blob get 2983850 0x48656C6C6F 0x6e2b64874f7daca3d61c3302ecff5634d9ac0a01d58b4b41417c4e1cacd26a9a
```

In response, you'll see the data you posted:

```bash
{
  "result": {
    "namespace": "0x48656C6C6F",
    "data": "\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" -Leonardo da Vinci",
    "share_version": 0,
    "commitment": "0x5fdba4ca4a3012fcf66569a5fe0a23e9f0681f79b8f6f3d53bac99de0aa21312",
    "index": 781
  }
}
```

Let's break it down:

- `namespace`: The [namespace](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/namespace.html) you used to categorize your data.
- `data`: The data blob you posted to the network.
- `share_version`: The version of the [share](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/shares.html). A share is a fixed-size data chunk that is associated with exactly one namespace.
- `commitment`: The commitment of the data (see [Blob Share Commitment Rules](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/data_square_layout.html#blob-share-commitment-rules)).
- `index`: The [index](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/shares.html#overview) of the data share in the square.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to run a light node to post and retrieve data from Celestia's Mocha testnet.

:::tip
If you see a response like this, you'll either need to let the node sync to the `requestedHeight`, or use [the trusted hash quick sync guide](./celestia-node-trusted-hash.md):

```bash
{
  "result": "header: syncing in progress: localHeadHeight: 94721, requestedHeight: 2983850"
}
```

## Diving deeper into the stack

### Get your auth token

Your auth token may be useful when you want to interact with your Celestia light node from a client application. You can get your auth token by running:

```bash
celestia light auth admin --p2p.network mocha
```

Use `celestia light auth --help` to learn more about the available options.

### Key management with cel-key

In the first part of this guide, we generated a key when we initialized the light node.

An advanced option for key management is using the `cel-key` utility, which is a separate tool from the `celestia` binary. `cel-key` is a key management tool that allows you to create, import, and manage keys for your Celestia DA node.

If you're using the quickstart script above, you will have to build `cel-key` separately from source. You can find the instructions for building `cel-key` in the [celestia-node](./celestia-node.md) documentation.

### Rust client tutorial

If you're interested in writing a Rust program to interact with your Celestia light node, check out the [Rust client tutorial](../tutorials/rust-client-tutorial.md).

### Golang client tutorial

If you're interested in writing a Golang program to interact with your Celestia light node, check out the [Golang client tutorial](../tutorials/golang-client-tutorial.md).

### Node store contents

As described in the [initialize the light node section](#initialize-the-light-node) above, the node store is created in the `~/.celestia-<node-type>-<network>` directory.

In this guide, the node store for `~/.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}` contains the following directories:

- `config.toml`: Node configuration settings
- `data/`: Contains database files
  - `.vlog` files: Value log files storing actual data
  - `.sst` files: Static sorted tables containing indexed data
  - System files: `DISCARD`, `KEYREGISTRY`, and `MANIFEST` for database management
- `keys/`: Stores node identity and account keys
  - Contains encoded node identifiers
  - `keyring-test/`: Test keyring directory storing
    - `.address` files: Account addresses
    - `.info` files: Key metadata and information
