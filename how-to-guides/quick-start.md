Welcome to Celestia's quick-start guide! In this guide, we'll learn how to run a Celestia data availability sampling (DAS) light node to post and retrieve data blobs on Celestia's [Mocha testnet](./mocha-testnet.md).

A blob (a.k.a. [BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage#Origins)) is a Binary Large OBject. In other words, a blob is arbitrary data. In this case, it's data that you want to post and make available on Celestia's data availability (DA) layer.

Your light node will allow you to post data, and then use DAS to sample and retrieve it from the DA network. Let's get started!

## Run a light node

First we'll need to install the `celestia` binary to run our DAS light node. Use the following command to install a pre-built binary of [celestia-node](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node), for the latest release for Mocha testnet:

> For this guide, select either your Go bin or system bin directory when prompted. If you're curious what [the script](https://github.com/celestiaorg/docs/tree/main/public/celestia-node.sh) is doing, check out [the celestia-node page](./celestia-node.md#installing-a-pre-built-binary).

```bash-vue
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://docs.celestia.org/celestia-node.sh)" -- -v {{mochaVersions['node-latest-tag']}}
```

Once you've installed `celestia`, double-check that you're using the right version by running:

```bash
celestia version
```

You should see the version of the binary that you just installed. Use `celestia --help` to see the CLI menu.

### Initialize the light node

Initializing your light node will set up configuration files and create a keypair for your node.

The `p2p.network` flag is used to specify the network you want to connect to. Use `mocha` for Mocha testnet.

> The chain ID `{{ constants.mochaChainId }}` is also an accepted alias.

```bash
celestia light init --p2p.network mocha
```

Once you've run this command, you'll see a new keypair that's created in your terminal. Be sure to save your mnemonic somewhere safe for future use!

```bash-vue
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:31	Initializing Light Node Store over '/Users/js/.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}'
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:64	Saved config	{"path": "/Users/js/.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}/config.toml"}
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:66	Accessing keyring...
WARN	node	nodebuilder/init.go:196	Detected plaintext keyring backend. For elevated security properties, consider using the `file` keyring backend.
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:211	NO KEY FOUND IN STORE, GENERATING NEW KEY...	{"path": "/Users/js/.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}/keys"}
INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:216	NEW KEY GENERATED...

ADDRESS: celestia1lgvzg4ek9v499pl5vvsvqpquhwfg0jznpwd92m
MNEMONIC (save this somewhere safe!!!):
never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you never gonna make you cry never gonna

INFO	node	nodebuilder/init.go:73	Node Store initialized
```

You'll also see in this example, using the Mocha testnet and setting up a light node, our node store will be at: `~/.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}`.

> Logs above have the timestamps removed for brevity. And yes, that's a Rickroll mnemonic. ðŸ˜œ

#### Set the trusted hash

Setting and syncing to a trusted hash and height means your light node will not sample the entire chain. This is useful when you want to sync your light node quickly. However, it's important to note that this adds the trust assumption that you trust the entity where you get the hash and height from, in this case, the [P-OPS](https://pops.one)  team's consensus endpoint.

Let's set the trusted hash!

1. Get trusted height & hash from the P-OPS consensus endpoint:

    ```bash
    export TRUSTED_HEIGHT=$(curl -s "https://rpc-mocha.pops.one/header" | jq -r '.result.header.height') && export TRUSTED_HASH=$(curl -s "https://rpc-mocha.pops.one/header" | jq -r '.result.header.last_block_id.hash') && echo "Height: $TRUSTED_HEIGHT" && echo "Hash: $TRUSTED_HASH"
    ```

1. Set the trusted height & hash
    1. Open your `config.toml` at `.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}/config.toml`
    1. Set `DASer.SampleFrom` to the trusted height (e.g. `SampleFrom = 123456`)

> If you dont do this, when trying to retrieve data in a few minutes, you'll see a response saying `"result": "header: syncing in progress: localHeadHeight: 94721, requestedHeight: 2983850"`. You'll either need to let the node sync to the `requestedHeight`, or use quick sync with trusted hash to do this.
Learn more in [the trusted hash quick sync guide](./celestia-node-trusted-hash.md).

### Start the light node

Run the following command to start your light node:

In the same terminal you initialized the node store and set the variable for `TRUSTED_HASH`, start the node with the hash and flag:

```bash
celestia light start --headers.trusted-hash $TRUSTED_HASH \
    --p2p.network mocha --core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one
```

The `core.ip` flag is used to specify the consensus RPC endpoints you want to connect to, this is the same one we got the trusted height and hash from. We'll use `rpc-mocha.pops.one` from the P-OPS team for Mocha testnet. The `headers.trusted-hash` flag will set the trusted hash from the previous section.

Once you see this in the logs, you're ready to start posting and retrieving data!

```bash-vue
/_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/

Started celestia DA node
node version: 	{{mochaVersions['node-latest-tag'].slice(1)}}
node type: 	light
network: 	{{ constants.mochaChainId }}

/_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/  /_____/
```

:::tip
If you want to see that your node is synced, use the `celestia das sampling-stats` command to check it in another terminal:

```bash
{
  "result": {
    "head_of_sampled_chain": 2990507,
    "head_of_catchup": 2990507,
    "network_head_height": 2990507,
    "concurrency": 0,
    "catch_up_done": true,
    "is_running": true
  }
}
```

## Post and retrieve data with your light node

### Funding your light node

Now, we're almost ready to start posting data!

Open a second terminal instance for the remainder of this guide. Let's find our address for the node we have running by running:

```bash
celestia state account-address
```

Take this account address and head over to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity) and request tokens from the `#mocha-faucet` channel.

Once you've requested tokens, can check the balance of your running node using:

```bash
celestia state balance
```

### Posting data

Now that you have tokens in your account, you can post data to the network. Let's break down the arguments you'll provide to the CLI:

```bash
celestia blob submit [namespace] [blobData]
```

The `[namespace]` is a permissionless way to categorize your data on Celestia. In other words, it's a channel for you to post your data. For example, this could be the name of your project or a category for the type of blob. In this example, we'll use `0x71756f746573` as the namespace, which is the hex encoding of "quotes". See the ["quotes" namespace on Celenium](https://mocha.celenium.io/namespace/0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000071756f746573?tab=Blobs).

> Learn more about namespaces in [the celestia-app documentation](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/namespace.html).

The `[blobData]` is the blob data you want to post to the network. In this example, we'll use a quote from Leonardo da Vinci:

:::tip
Feeling creative? Post your favorite quote and [share it on Twitter](https://x.com/JoshCStein/status/1849553273470263636)!
:::

```bash
celestia blob submit 0x71756f746573 '"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." -Leonardo da Vinci'
```

Once you run this command, you'll see a height and data committment in the response. This means your data has been successfully posted to the network!

```bash
{
  "result": {
    "height": 2990556,
    "commitments": [
      "0x715ab246772c923104c556dc28d5d4fcfca0398b0a252bcd19dd5705495756ac"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Retrieving data

To retrieve the data you posted, use the following command:

```bash
celestia blob get [height] [namespace] [committment]
```

In this example, you'll use the height and commitment from the response above:

```bash
celestia blob get 2990556 0x71756f746573 0x715ab246772c923104c556dc28d5d4fcfca0398b0a252bcd19dd5705495756ac
```

In response, you'll see the data you posted:

```bash
{
  "result": {
    "namespace": "0x71756f746573",
    "data": "\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" -Leonardo da Vinci",
    "share_version": 0,
    "commitment": "0x715ab246772c923104c556dc28d5d4fcfca0398b0a252bcd19dd5705495756ac",
    "index": 29
  }
}
```

Let's break it down:

- `namespace`: The [namespace](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/namespace.html) you used to categorize your data.
- `data`: The data blob you posted to the network.
- `share_version`: The version of the [share](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/shares.html). A share is a fixed-size data chunk that is associated with exactly one namespace.
- `commitment`: The commitment of the data (see [Blob Share Commitment Rules](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/data_square_layout.html#blob-share-commitment-rules)).
- `index`: The [index](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/shares.html#overview) of the data share in the square.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to run a light node to post and retrieve data from Celestia's Mocha testnet.

## Diving deeper into the stack

This section covers some more in-depth topics that you may find useful when working with your Celestia light node.

### Get your auth token

Your auth token may be useful when you want to interact with your Celestia light node from a client application. You can get your auth token by running:

```bash
celestia light auth admin --p2p.network mocha
```

Use `celestia light auth --help` to learn more about the available options.

### Key management with cel-key

In the first part of this guide, we generated a key when we initialized the light node.

An advanced option for key management is using the `cel-key` utility, which is a separate tool from the `celestia` binary. `cel-key` is a key management tool that allows you to create, import, and manage keys for your Celestia DA node.

If you're using the quickstart script above, you will have to build `cel-key` separately from source. You can find the instructions for building `cel-key` in the [celestia-node](./celestia-node.md) documentation.

### Node store contents

As described in the [initialize the light node section](#initialize-the-light-node) above, the node store is created in the `~/.celestia-<node-type>-<network>` directory.

In this guide, the node store for `~/.celestia-light-{{ constants.mochaChainId }}` contains the following directories and file types:

- `config.toml`: Node configuration settings
- `data/`: Contains database files
  - `.vlog` files: Value log files storing actual data
  - `.sst` files: Static sorted tables containing indexed data
  - System files: `DISCARD`, `KEYREGISTRY`, and `MANIFEST` for database management
- `keys/`: Stores node identity and account keys
  - Contains encoded node identifiers
  - `keyring-test/`: Test keyring directory
    - `.address` files: Account addresses
    - `.info` files: Key metadata and information
