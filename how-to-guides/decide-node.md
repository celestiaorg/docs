# Deciding which node to run

Now that you have installed the basic dependencies,
you can start exploring which nodes to run!

## Light node

It is highly recommended to
get started with running a data availability [light node](./light-node.md).

You can also play around with the Data Availability API in
[this tutorial for posting and retrieving data with a light node](../tutorials/node-tutorial.md).

### Other DA nodes

Depending on your use case, you also may want to run a [bridge node](./bridge-node.md)
or a [full DA node](./full-storage-node.md).

## Consensus node

If you are looking to run a consensus node, please follow the
[tutorial for running a consensus node](./full-consensus-node.md).

Note that running a validator means you must also run a bridge node,
which is covered in [this section](./bridge-node.md).
