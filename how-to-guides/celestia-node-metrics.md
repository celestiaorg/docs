# celestia-node metrics

This tutorial is for running metrics for your celestia-node data
availability instance. This tutorial will focus on running metrics for a light node.

This tutorial assumes you have already setup your light node
by following the tutorial in the
[celestia-node API tutorial](./tutorials/node-tutorial.md).

## Running metrics flags

You can enable the `celestia-node` metric flags with the following
command:

```sh
celestia <node-type> start --metrics.tls=<boolean> \
    --metrics --metrics.endpoint <URI> \
    --p2p.network <network> --core.ip <URI>
```

Add metrics flags to your node start command and restart your node to apply it.
The metrics endpoint will gather your node's data to track your uptime.

Note that the `--metrics` flag enables metrics and expects
an input into `--metrics.endpoint`.

We will go over what the endpoint will need to be in the
[metrics endpoint design considerations](#metrics-endpoint-design-considerations)
section.

### Mainnet Beta

Here is an example for Mainnet Beta:

```sh
celestia <node-type> start --metrics.tls=true \
    --metrics --metrics.endpoint otel.celestia.observer \
    --core.ip <URI>
```

### Mocha testnet

Here is an example for Mocha testnet:

```sh
celestia <node-type> start --metrics.tls=true \
    --metrics --metrics.endpoint otel.celestia-mocha.com \
    --core.ip <URI> --p2p.network mocha
```

### TLS connections

The `--metrics.tls` flag enables or disables a TLS connection to the
OpenTelemetry Protocol metrics backend. You need to choose a boolean
value (`true` or `false`) for this flag.

It's also common to set this flag to `false` when spinning up a local
collector
to check the metrics locally.

However, if the collector is hosted in the cloud as a separate entity
(like in a DevOps environment), enabling TLS is a necessity for secure
communication.

Here are examples of how to use it:

```bash
# To enable TLS connection
celestia <node-type> start --metrics.tls=true --metrics \
    --metrics.endpoint <URI> \
    --p2p.network <network> --core.ip <URI>

# To disable TLS connection
celestia <node-type> start --metrics.tls=false --metrics \
    --metrics.endpoint <URI> \
    --p2p.network <network> --core.ip <URI>
```

## Metrics endpoint design considerations

At the moment, the architecture of celestia-node metrics
works as specified in the following [ADR #010](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/blob/main/docs/adr/adr-010-incentivized-testnet-monitoring.md).

Essentially, the design considerations here will necessitate
running an OpenTelemetry (OTEL) collector that connects to Celestia
light node.

For an overview of OTEL, check out [the guide](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector).

The ADR and the OTEL docs will help you run your collector on the metrics endpoint.
This will then allow you to process the data in the collector on a
Prometheus server which can then be viewed on a Grafana dashboard.

In the future, we do want to open-source some developer toolings around
this infrastructure to allow for node operators to be able to monitor
their data availability nodes.
