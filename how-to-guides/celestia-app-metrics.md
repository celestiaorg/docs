# Metrics

Metrics are a powerful tool for monitoring the health
and performance of a system. Celestia provides support
for metrics to make sure, as an operator, your system
continues to remain up and running. Metrics can also
provide critical insight into how Celestia is used and
how it can be improved.

## Setup

Celestia uses [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to
publish metrics. It can be enabled through the `config.toml` file.

```bash
#######################################################
###       Instrumentation Configuration Options     ###
#######################################################
[instrumentation]

# When true, Prometheus metrics are served under /metrics on
# PrometheusListenAddr.
# Check out the documentation for the list of available metrics.
prometheus = true

# Address to listen for Prometheus collector(s) connections
prometheus_listen_addr = ":26660"

# Maximum number of simultaneous connections.
# If you want to accept a larger number than the default, make sure
# you increase your OS limits.
# 0 - unlimited.
max_open_connections = 3

# Instrumentation namespace
namespace = "celestia"
```

If you restart your node, you can check to see it's working
by running:

```bash
curl localhost:26660/metrics
```

## Visualization

Now your nodes are publishing metrics, we need something to
scrape it and a visualizer to create a dashboard. Commonly,
Prometheus is paired with Grafana.

First, you will need to install Prometheus either from their
[downloads page](https://prometheus.io/download/) or through
a package manager like `brew`.

Next, create a config file `$HOME/.celestia-app/config/prometheus.yml`
and fill out some basic settings as follows:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating
  # with external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: "codelab-monitor"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries
  # scraped from this config.
  - job_name: "prometheus"

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every
    # 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      # Point to the same endpoint that Celestia is publishing on
      - targets: ["localhost:26660"]
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Note, that Prometheus by default runs its server on `:9090`.
If you are running this on the same machine as your consensus
node, it will collide with gRPC which runs on the same port.
To avoid this, either switch off gRPC (if it's not needed),
change the gRPC port in `app.toml`, or run Prometheus on a
different port e.g. `--web.listen-address="0.0.0.0:8000"`

To run the prometheus server:

```bash
prometheus --config.file="$HOME/.celestia-app/config/prometheus.yml"
```

A prometheus server can scrape metrics from multiple nodes at once;
a good way of bringing together information from many machines to one place.

To visualize the information, you can use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/):
either with their cloud option or run the [open source code](https://grafana.com/grafana/download?pg=graf&platform=linux&plcmt=deploy-box-1)
yourself.

Once setup, run:

```bash
grafana server
```

which will begin a server on `localhost:3000`.
If you open the url on your browser you will
see the Grafana login page. Use `admin` for both
the user and password to log in.

You will need to link the prometheus server as a
data source. To do that go to "Configuration" in
the sidebar and then "Data Sources". Add a new data
source specifying the URL of the Prometheus instance
(default at `localhost:9090`). Click "Save & test" to confirm.

Lastly, you will need to setup a dashboard. You can
choose to do this yourself, handpicking the metrics
that are important or you can simply export an existing
design. Fortunately the cosmos ecosystem has conjured a
"Cosmos Dashboard". On the sidebar, click "Dashboards"
and then "import". Enter the following dashboard ID: 11036
and then link it to the "Prometheus" data source you just set up.
Finally click the "Import" button and the "Cosmos Dashboard" should appear.

## Node exporter

Celestia's metrics include a plethora of application specific
trackers but it's also important to keep an eye on system level
metrics such as memory usage and disk space. This can be best
achieved by running [Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/).
Follow the guide in the link to get set up, adding the port
number to the `prometheus.yml` file.

## Alerts

The final cherry on the cake is to integrate your monitoring
system with a mechanism for producing alerts to warn you if
your node has crashed or is no longer able to stay at the head
of the chain.

Since we're already using Grafana, we can install the
[Grafana OnCall](http://localhost:3000/plugins/grafana-oncall-app)
plugin. OnCall allows you to setup integrations. It could be a
webhook or a direct integration into Telegram or Slack.
You can find more information on Grafana's [Docs Page](https://grafana.com/docs/oncall/latest/integrations/).
