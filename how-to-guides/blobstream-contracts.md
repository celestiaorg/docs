# Integrate with Blobstream contracts

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following installed:

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)

### Installing Blobstream contracts

We will be using the [`IDAOracle`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/src/IDAOracle.sol)
interface to verify inclusion. 
So, we will install the Blobstream contracts repo as a dependency:

```sh
forge install celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts --no-commit
```

Make sure that the directory you're running this command
from is an initialized git repository. If not, just
initialize the repo using: 

```sh
git init
```

Note that the minimum Solidity compiler version for using the Blobstream
contracts is `0.8.19`.

### Example usage

Example minimal Solidity contract for a stub ZK rollup that leverages the
`BlobstreamX.sol` contract to check that data has been posted to Celestia:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "blobstream-contracts/IDAOracle.sol";
import "blobstream-contracts/DataRootTuple.sol";
import "blobstream-contracts/lib/tree/binary/BinaryMerkleProof.sol";

contract MyRollup {
    IDAOracle immutable blobstream;
    bytes32[] public rollup_block_hashes;

    constructor(IDAOracle _blobstream) {
        blobstream = _blobstream;
    }

    function submitRollupBlock(
        bytes32 _rollup_block_hash,
        bytes calldata _zk_proof,
        uint256 _blobstream_nonce,
        DataRootTuple calldata _tuple,
        BinaryMerkleProof calldata _proof
    ) public {
        // Verify that the data root tuple (analog. block header) has been
        // attested to by the Blobstream contract.
        require(
            blobstream.verifyAttestation(_blobstream_nonce, _tuple, _proof)
        );

        // Verify the ZKP (zero-knowledge proof).
        // _tuple.dataRoot is a public input, leaves (shares) are private inputs.
        require(verifyZKP(_rollup_block_hash, _zk_proof, _tuple.dataRoot));

        // Everything checks out, append rollup block hash to list.
        rollup_block_hashes.push(_rollup_block_hash);
    }

    function verifyZKP(
        bytes32 _rollup_block_hash,
        bytes calldata _zk_proof,
        bytes32 _data_root
    ) private pure returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Data structures

Each [`DataRootTuple`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/src/DataRootTuple.sol)
is a tuple of block height and data root. It is analogous to a Celestia block
header. `DataRootTuple`s are relayed in batches, committed to as a
`DataRootTuple`s root (i.e. a Merkle root of `DataRootTuple`s).

The [`BinaryMerkleProof`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/src/lib/tree/binary/BinaryMerkleProof.sol)
is an [RFC-6962](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962.html)-compliant Merkle
proof. Since `DataRootTuple`s are Merkleized in a binary Merkle tree, verifying
the inclusion of a `DataRootTuple` against a `DataRootTuple`s root requires
verifying a Merkle inclusion proof.

## Interface

The [`IDAOracle`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/src/IDAOracle.sol)
(**D**ata **A**vailability **O**racle Interface) interface allows L2 contracts
on Ethereum to query the `BlobstreamX.sol` contract for relayed `DataRootTuple`s.
The single interface method `verifyAttestation` verifies a Merkle inclusion
proof that a `DataRootTuple` is included under a specific batch (indexed by
batch nonce). In other words, analogously it verifies that a specific block
header is included in the Celestia chain.

## Querying the proof

To prove that the data was published to Celestia, check out the
[proof queries documentation](./blobstream-proof-queries.md)
to understand how to query the proofs from Celestia consensus
nodes and make them usable in the Blobstream X verifier contract.

## Verifying data inclusion for fraud proofs

A high-level overview of how a fraud-proof based L2 would interact with
Blobstream can be found in the [inclusion proofs documentation](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/docs/inclusion-proofs.md).

The [`DAVerifier`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/src/lib/verifier/DAVerifier.sol)
library is available at `blobstream-contracts/lib/verifier/DAVerifier.sol`, and
provides functions to verify the inclusion of individual (or multiple) shares
against a `DataRootTuple`. The library is stateless, and allows to pass an
`IDAOracle` interface as a parameter to verify inclusion against it.

In the `DAVerifier` library, we find functions that help
with data inclusion verification and calculating the square size of a
Celestia block. These functions work with the Blobstream X smart contract,
using different proofs to check and confirm the data's availability. Let's
take a closer look at these functions:

- [`verifySharesToDataRootTupleRoot`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/3a552d8f7bfbed1f3175933260e6e440915d2da4/src/lib/verifier/DAVerifier.sol#L80-L124):
  This function verifies that the
  shares, which were posted to Celestia, were committed to by the Blobstream X
  smart contract. It checks that the data root was committed to by the
  Blobstream X smart contract and that the shares were committed to by the
  rows roots.
- [`verifyRowRootToDataRootTupleRoot`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/3a552d8f7bfbed1f3175933260e6e440915d2da4/src/lib/verifier/DAVerifier.sol#L133-L155):
  This function verifies that a
  row/column root, from a Celestia block, was committed to by the
  Blobstream X smart contract. It checks that the data root was committed
  to by the Blobstream X smart contract and that the row root commits to
  the data root.
- [`verifyMultiRowRootsToDataRootTupleRoot`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/3a552d8f7bfbed1f3175933260e6e440915d2da4/src/lib/verifier/DAVerifier.sol#L164-L194):
  This function verifies
  that a set of rows/columns, from a Celestia block, were committed
  to by the Blobstream X smart contract. It checks that the data root was
  committed to by the Blobstream X smart contract and that the rows roots
  commit to the data root.
- [`computeSquareSizeFromRowProof`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/3a552d8f7bfbed1f3175933260e6e440915d2da4/src/lib/verifier/DAVerifier.sol#L204-L215):
  This function computes the Celestia
  block square size from a row/column root to data root binary Merkle
  proof. It is the user's responsibility to verify that the proof is
  valid and was successfully committed to using the
  `verifyRowRootToDataRootTupleRoot()` method.
- [`computeSquareSizeFromShareProof`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/3a552d8f7bfbed1f3175933260e6e440915d2da4/src/lib/verifier/DAVerifier.sol#L224-L229):
  This function computes the
  Celestia block square size from a shares to row/column root proof.
  It is the user's responsibility to verify that the proof is valid
  and that the shares were successfully committed to using the
  `verifySharesToDataRootTupleRoot()` method.
