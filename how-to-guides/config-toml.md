# config.toml guide

## Pre-requisites

Please, make sure that you have installed and initialized `celestia-node`

## Viewing the help menu

In order to view all flags and their descriptions, use:

```bash
celestia light start --help
```

## Understanding config.toml

After initialization, for any type of node, you will find a
`config.toml` in the following path (default location):

- `$HOME/.celestia-bridge/config.toml` for bridge node
- `$HOME/.celestia-light/config.toml` for light node
- `$HOME/.celestia-full/config.toml` for a full DA node

Let's break down some of the most used sections.

### Core

This section is needed for the Celestia bridge node.
By default, `Remote = false`. Still for devnet, we are going
to use the remote core option and this can also be set
by the command line flag `--core.remote`.

### P2P

#### Bootstrap

Bootstrappers help new nodes to find peers faster in the network.
By default, the `Bootstrapper = false` and the `BootstrapPeers` is empty.
If you want your node to be a bootstrapper, then activate `Bootstrapper = true`.
`BootstrapPeers` are already provided by default during initialisation.
If you want to add your own manually, you need to provide the
multiaddresses of the peers.

#### Mutual peers

The purpose of this config is to set up a bidirectional communication.
This is usually the case for Celestia bridge nodes. In addition, you
need to change the field `PeerExchange` from false to true.

### Services

#### TrustedHash and TrustedPeer

`TrustedHash` is needed to properly initialize a Celestia bridge
node with an already-running `Remote` celestia-core node. Celestia
light node will take a genesis hash as the trusted one, if no hash
is manually provided during initialization phase.

`TrustedPeers` is the array of bridge nodes' peers that Celestia
light node trusts. By default, bootstrap peers becomes trusted peers
for Celestia light nodes if a user is not setting the trusted peer params
in config file.

Any Celestia bridge node can be a trusted peer for the light one. However,
the light node by design can not be a trusted peer for another light node.
