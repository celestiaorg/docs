# Staking on Celestia

Engage with the Celestia network at a deeper level through staking. An
essential mechanism to a proof-of-stake network, users can secure the
network by delegating to a validator and receive a share of its
staking rewards.

As of [CIP-30](https://cips.celestia.org/cip-030.html), when delegators modify their staking positions (_e.g._, redelegate or undelegate), the distribution no longer auto-claim rewards on delegation-share changes. Instead, rewards are accrued until the user calls `MsgWithdrawDelegatorReward`.
