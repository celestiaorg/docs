# Submitting data blobs to Celestia

To submit data to Celestia, users submit blob transactions (`BlobTx`). Blob
transactions contain two components, a standard Cosmos-SDK transaction called
`MsgPayForBlobs` and one or more `Blob`s of data.

## Maximum blob size

As of **v6**, the maximum transaction size on all networks is **8 MiB (8,388,608 bytes)**. This cap applies to the _entire_ transaction—including the PFB, all blobs, and overhead—so the maximum total blob size is slightly smaller than 8 MiB.

The _exact_ maximum total blob size in a transaction depends on:

- the number of shares available after accounting for the PFB transaction,
- the share version and layout rules,
- and the fact that the **first sparse share has 478 bytes**, while **all subsequent sparse shares have 482 bytes**.

The current max square size on Arabica is 128 MiB, Mocha is 32 MiB, and Mainnet is 8 MiB.

Under v6 and future upgrades, networks will use larger square sizes, so the absolute maximum blob capacity per transaction will increase correspondingly—up to the global **8 MiB transaction size limit**, which is now the binding constraint.

See the [Mainnet Beta page under “Transaction size limit”](/operate/networks/mainnet-beta#transaction-size-limit) for details.

## Fee market and mempool

Celestia makes use of a standard gas-priced prioritized mempool. By default,
transactions with gas prices higher than that of other transactions in the mempool
will be prioritized by validators.

### Fee estimation

Celestia-node provides flexible fee estimation options for submitting transactions:

1. **Default estimation**: By default, fee estimation relies on the consensus node to which the node is connected.

2. **Third-party estimation**: Users can specify a separate endpoint for fee estimation using the `--core.estimator.address` flag in the CLI. This allows using a dedicated service for fee estimation.

3. **Maximum gas price**: Users can set a maximum gas price they're willing to pay for transactions using the `--max.gas.price` flag. If the estimated gas price exceeds this maximum, the transaction will not be submitted. The default maximum is set to 100 times the minimum gas price (0.2 TIA).

<Callout type="info" title="Fee estimation differs by transaction type">
- PayForBlobs (PFB) transactions: Only the gas price (cost per unit) is dynamically estimated. The gas usage (number of units) uses a fixed calculation method.
- All other transactions: Both gas price and gas usage are dynamically estimated.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Third-party estimation version requirement">
When using third-party estimation, the consensus endpoint must be running celestia-app v3.8.1 or higher.
</Callout>

### Fees and gas limits

As of version v1.0.0 of the application (celestia-app), there is no protocol
enforced minimum fee (similar to EIP-1559 in Ethereum). Instead, each
consensus node running a mempool uses a locally configured gas price threshold
that must be met in order for that node to accept a transaction, either directly
from a user or gossiped from another node, into its mempool.

As of version v1.0.0 of the application (celestia-app), gas is not refunded.
Instead, transaction fees are deducted by a flat fee, originally specified by
the user in their tx (where fees = gasLimit \* gasPrice). This means that
users should use an accurate gas limit value if they do not wish to overpay.

Under the hood, fees are currently handled by specifying and deducting a flat
fee. However gas price is often specified by users instead of calculating the
flat fee from the gas used and the gas price. Since the state machine does not
refund users for unused gas, gas price is calculated by dividing the total fee
by the gas limit.

#### Estimating PFB gas

Generally, the gas used by a PFB transaction involves a static fixed cost and
a dynamic cost based on the size of each blob in the transaction.

<Callout type="info" title="Static costs can vary">
For a general use case of a normal account submitting a PFB, the static
costs can be treated as such. However, due to the description above of how gas
works in the Cosmos-SDK this is not always the case. Notably, if a
vesting account or the `feegrant` modules are used, then these static costs change.
</Callout>

The fixed cost is an approximation of the gas consumed by operations outside
the function `GasToConsume` (for example, signature verification, tx size, read
access to accounts), which has a default value of 65,000 gas.

<Callout type="info" title="First transaction costs more">
The first transaction sent by an account (sequence number == 0) has an
additional one time gas cost of 10,000 gas. If this is the case, this
should be accounted for.
</Callout>

Each blob in the PFB contributes to the total gas cost based on its size. The
function `GasToConsume` calculates the total gas consumed by all the blobs
involved in a PFB, where each blob's gas cost is computed by first determining
how many shares are needed to store the blob size. Then, it computes the product
of the number of shares, the number of bytes per share, and the `gasPerByte`
parameter. Finally, it adds a static amount per blob.

The [`blob.GasPerBlobByte`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/29906a468910184f221b42be0a15898722a2b08f/specs/src/parameters_v6.md?plain=1#L33)
and [`auth.TxSizeCostPerByte`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/29906a468910184f221b42be0a15898722a2b08f/specs/src/parameters_v6.md?plain=1#L31)
are parameters that
could potentially be adjusted through the system's governance mechanisms. Hence,
actual costs may vary depending on the current state of these parameters.

#### Gas fee calculation

The total fee for a transaction is calculated as the product of the gas limit
for the transaction and the gas price set by the user:

$$
\text{Total Fee} = \text{Gas Limit} \times \text{Gas Price}
$$

The gas limit for a transaction is the maximum amount of gas that a user is
willing to spend on a transaction. It is determined by both a static
fixed cost (FC) and a variable dynamic cost based on the size of each blob involved
in the transaction:

$$
\text{Gas Limit} = FC + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SSN}(B_i) \times SS \times GCPBB
$$

Where:

- $FC$ = Fixed Cost, is a static value (65,000 gas)
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SSN}(B_i)$ = SparseSharesNeeded for the ith Blob, is the number of shares needed for the ith blob in the transaction
- $SS$ = Share Size, is the size of each share
- $GCPBB$ = Gas Cost Per Blob Byte, is a parameter that could potentially be adjusted through the system's governance mechanisms.

The gas fee is set by the user when they submit a transaction. The fee is often
specified by users directly. The total cost for the transaction is then
calculated as the product of the estimated gas limit and the gas price.
Since the state machine does not refund users for unused gas,
it's important for users to estimate the gas limit accurately to
avoid overpaying.

For more details on how gas is calculated per blob, refer to the
[`PayForBlobs` function](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/32d247971386c1944d44bec1faeb000b1ff1dd51/x/blob/keeper/keeper.go#L53)
that consumes gas based on the blob sizes. This function uses the
[`GasToConsume` function](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/32d247971386c1944d44bec1faeb000b1ff1dd51/x/blob/types/payforblob.go#L157-L167)
to calculate the extra gas charged to pay for a set of blobs in a `MsgPayForBlobs`
transaction. This function calculates the total shares used by all blobs and
multiplies it by the `ShareSize` and `gasPerByte` to get the total gas to consume.

For estimating the total gas required for a set of blobs, refer to the
[`EstimateGas` function](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/32d247971386c1944d44bec1faeb000b1ff1dd51/x/blob/types/payforblob.go#L169-L181).
This function estimates the gas based on a linear model that is dependent on
the governance parameters: `gasPerByte` and `txSizeCost`. It assumes other
variables are constant, including the assumption that the `MsgPayForBlobs`
is the only message in the transaction. The `DefaultEstimateGas` function
runs `EstimateGas` with the system defaults.

#### Estimating gas programmatically

Users can estimate an efficient gas limit by using this function:

```go
import (
    blobtypes "github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/x/blob/types"
)
gasLimit := blobtypes.DefaultEstimateGas([]uint32{uint32(sizeOfDataInBytes)})
```

If using a celestia-node light client, then this function is automatically
called for you when submitting a blob. This function works by breaking down the
components of calculating gas for a blob transaction. These components consist
of a flat costs for all PFBs, the size of each blob and how many shares each
uses and the parameter for gas used per byte. More information about how gas is
used can be found in the [gas
specs](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/d17e231ae3a0150b50a1854f3e9a268c34502b6b/specs/src/specs/resource_pricing.md)
and the exact formula can be found in the [blob
module](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/d17e231ae3a0150b50a1854f3e9a268c34502b6b/x/blob/types/payforblob.go#L157-L181).

## Transaction submission strategies

Celestia-node offers three transaction submission modes, controlled by the `TxWorkerAccounts` configuration parameter in your node's
state config in `config.toml`. Each mode has different throughput characteristics and ordering guarantees.

### Default behavior (TxWorkerAccounts = 0)

By default, `TxWorkerAccounts` is set to `0`, which means queued submission is disabled. All PayForBlobs transactions are submitted
immediately to the mempool without waiting for confirmations. This is the same behavior as versions prior to [v0.28.2-arabica](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/releases/tag/v0.28.2-arabica).

The mempool maintains a fork of the canonical state each block, updating the sequence number (nonce) for each account that submits a
transaction. If you wish to submit multiple transactions from the same account in quick succession, you must specify the nonce
manually. Otherwise, subsequent transactions will not be accepted until the first transaction is reaped from the mempool (included in
a block) or dropped after timing out.

By default, nodes will drop a transaction if it does not get included in 12 blocks (roughly 72 seconds). At this point, you must
resubmit your transaction if you want it to eventually be included.

<Callout type="warning" title="No replace-by-fee">
As of v1.0.0 of celestia-app, you cannot replace an existing transaction with a higher-fee version. You must wait 5 blocks from the
original submission time and then resubmit the transaction.
</Callout>

### Synchronous submission (TxWorkerAccounts = 1)

Setting `TxWorkerAccounts` to `1` enables synchronous, queued transaction submission:

```toml
[State]
  TxWorkerAccounts = 1
```

Characteristics:

- Each transaction queues until the previous one is confirmed
- Preserves strict ordering of transactions
- Avoids sequence mismatch errors
- Throughput: approximately 1 PayForBlobs transaction every other block

<Callout type="warning" title="Queue bypass caveat">
If you specify an account other than the default account in TxConfig, the queue is bypassed and transactions enter the mempool
directly without waiting for confirmations.
</Callout>

### Parallel transaction submission (TxWorkerAccounts > 1)

<Callout type="info" title="Network availability">
This feature is currently available on Arabica devnet and Mocha testnet (v0.28.2-arabica and later).
</Callout>

For high-throughput applications that do not require sequential transaction ordering, you can enable parallel transaction submission
by setting `TxWorkerAccounts` to a value > 1:

```toml
[State]
  DefaultKeyName = "my_celes_key"
  DefaultBackendName = "test"
  TxWorkerAccounts = 8
```

#### How it works:

`TxWorkerAccounts` defines how many parallel lanes the node will initialize for submitting transactions. These lanes are implemented as
subaccounts that are automatically:

1. Created and derived from your default account
2. Funded by your default account
3. Added to your node's keyring

This bypasses account sequence limits and enables significantly higher throughput.

Example: TxWorkerAccounts = 8 creates 7 subaccounts plus your 1 default account, allowing at least 8 PayForBlobs transactions per
block.

#### Important considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Parallel submission is unordered">
Parallel submission is not suitable for implementations that require sequential transaction ordering. Only use this mode for
unordered transaction workflows where your system requires a single signer, a.k.a. authored blobs.
</Callout>

#### Key points to understand:

- Account opacity: You will not know which subaccount signed which blob. Subaccounts are managed automatically by the node.
- Default account only: Parallel submission only works with your node's default account. If you specify a different account in
  TxConfig, parallel submission is bypassed.
- Blob retrieval: Since you don't know which account submitted each blob, retrieve your blobs using namespace, height, and commitment.

### Retrieving blobs submitted via parallel lanes

When using parallel submission, retrieve your blobs using the following RPC methods:

- [blob.Get](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#blob.Get) - Get blob by namespace and commitment
- [blob.GetProof](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#blob.GetProof) - Get inclusion proof by height, namespace, and commitment
- [blob.GetCommitmentProof](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#blob.GetCommitmentProof) - Get commitment proof by height, namespace, and share commitment

Example using blob.Get:

```bash
celestia blob get <height> <namespace> <commitment>
```

You should store the namespace, height, and commitment from your submission response to retrieve blobs later.

## API

Users can currently create and submit `BlobTx`s in six ways.

### The celestia-app consensus node CLI

```bash
celestia-appd tx blob PayForBlobs <hex-encoded namespace> <hex-encoded data> [flags]
```

### The celestia-node light node CLI

Using `blob.Submit`:

```bash
celestia blob submit <hex-encoded namespace> <hex-encoded data> [flags]
```

Available flags:

- `--core.estimator.address string`: Specifies the endpoint of the third-party service for gas price and gas estimation. Format: `<address>:<port>`. If not provided, the default connection to the consensus node will be used.
- `--max.gas.price`: Sets the maximum gas price you're willing to pay for the transaction. If the estimated gas price exceeds this value, the transaction will not be submitted. Default is 0.2 TIA (100x the minimum gas price).

Learn more in the [light node tutorial](/operate/data-availability/light-node/quickstart).

### The celestia-node API golang client

See the [golang client tutorial](/build/post-retrieve-blob/client/go).

### The celestia-node API Rust client

See the [Rust client tutorial](/build/post-retrieve-blob/client/rust).

### RPC to a celestia-node

Using the JSON RPC API, submit data using the following methods:

- [blob.Submit](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#blob.Submit)
- [state.SubmitPayForBlob](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#state.SubmitPayForBlob)

Learn more in the [celestia-node API docs](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/).

### Post a blob directly from Celenium

Celenium provides a user-friendly interface to view and interact with data on Celestia,
and allows for submitting blobs directly from the explorer interface.

To submit a blob from Celenium, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Celenium explorer](https://celenium.io) and connect your wallet.
2. Click on the terminal button in the top right corner of the screen and select the "Submit data blob" option.
3. Next, ensure the file you are submitting is in a supported format and upload it.
4. In the "Namespace" field, input the namespace you want to use for the blob in hex format.
5. Finally, click on the "Continue" button to submit your blob, then approve the transaction in your wallet.

Once the blob is submitted, you will see its hash on the screen.
You can also use Celenium’s search bar to search for the blob's hash and view its details.0:{"P":null,"b":"5DiMonWrxPT_SwxSvZouq","c":["","learn","TIA","submit-data",""],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["learn",{"children":["TIA",{"children":["submit-data",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/fdac6bbf6bfe4fdb.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/59683e49e5570b96.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L5",null,{"metadata":{"title":"Submitting data blobs to Celestia","filePath":"app/learn/TIA/submit-data/page.mdx","timestamp":1772147596000},"toc":[{"value":"Maximum blob size","id":"maximum-blob-size","depth":2},{"value":"Fee market and mempool","id":"fee-market-and-mempool","depth":2},{"value":"Fee estimation","id":"fee-estimation","depth":3},{"value":"Fees and gas limits","id":"fees-and-gas-limits","depth":3},{"value":"Estimating PFB gas","id":"estimating-pfb-gas","depth":4},{"value":"Gas fee calculation","id":"gas-fee-calculation","depth":4},{"value":"Estimating gas programmatically","id":"estimating-gas-programmatically","depth":4},{"value":"Transaction submission strategies","id":"transaction-submission-strategies","depth":2},{"value":"Default behavior (TxWorkerAccounts = 0)","id":"default-behavior-txworkeraccounts--0","depth":3},{"value":"Synchronous submission (TxWorkerAccounts = 1)","id":"synchronous-submission-txworkeraccounts--1","depth":3},{"value":"Parallel transaction submission (TxWorkerAccounts > 1)","id":"parallel-transaction-submission-txworkeraccounts--1","depth":3},{"value":"How it works:","id":"how-it-works","depth":4},{"value":"Important considerations","id":"important-considerations","depth":4},{"value":"Key points to understand:","id":"key-points-to-understand","depth":4},{"value":"Retrieving blobs submitted via parallel lanes","id":"retrieving-blobs-submitted-via-parallel-lanes","depth":3},{"value":"API","id":"api","depth":2},{"value":"The celestia-app consensus node CLI","id":"the-celestia-app-consensus-node-cli","depth":3},{"value":"The celestia-node light node CLI","id":"the-celestia-node-light-node-cli","depth":3},{"value":"The celestia-node API golang client","id":"the-celestia-node-api-golang-client","depth":3},{"value":"The celestia-node API Rust client","id":"the-celestia-node-api-rust-client","depth":3},{"value":"RPC to a celestia-node","id":"rpc-to-a-celestia-node","depth":3},{"value":"Post a blob directly from Celenium","id":"post-a-blob-directly-from-celenium","depth":3}],"sourceCode":"$6","children":"$L7"}],null,"$L8"]}],{},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false],"$L9",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$a",[]],"S":true}
