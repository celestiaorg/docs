Initially, it was set to decrease by 10% every year until reaching a long-term issuance rate of 1.5%. However, with the v4 Lotus upgrade (<a href="https://cips.celestia.org/cip-029.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CIP-29</a>) in July 2025, the inflation rate dropped from ~7.2% to ~5.0% at the time of the upgrade and will continue to decrease by 6.7% every year until it stabilizes at 1.5%. The diagram below illustrates both the initial inflation rates and those after the v4 upgrade.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="inflation diagram"></p><p>The annual provisions for inflation are calculated based on the total supply of TIA at the beginning of each year. To calculate how many TIA to issue per block, Celestia uses the block timestamp rather than the block height since the time between blocks can vary and cause actual issuance to be higher than the target.</p><p>For an in-depth understanding, refer to <a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-019-strict-inflation-schedule.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ADR019</a>.</p><h2 id="decentralised-governance" tabindex="-1">Decentralised governance <a class="header-anchor" href="#decentralised-governance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Decentralised governance&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="network-parameters" tabindex="-1">Network parameters <a class="header-anchor" href="#network-parameters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Network parameters&quot;">​</a></h3><p>TIA holders (not just stakers) can propose and vote on governance proposals to change a subset of network parameters.
