Each file contained in this directory represents a block on Celestia and contains its associated data.

The LSM files (such as <code>DISCARD</code>, <code>KEYREGISTRY</code>, and <code>MANIFEST</code>) manage the efficient storage and retrieval of data.</p></li><li><p><code>/index</code>: This directory stores the index files that handle mapping specific keys such as block heights, to the corresponding data. Similar to <code>/blocks</code>, the light node&#39;s datastore does not include this directory, as they do not perform indexing.</p></li><li><p><code>/inverted_index</code>: This directory stores the inverted index files used for mapping queries to the corresponding data location, along with associated LSM storage system files. The light node&#39;s datastore does not contain this directory.</p></li><li><p><code>/keys</code>: This directory stores the cryptographic key pairs that are used to operate the node.</p></li><li><p><code>/transients</code>: This directory contains temporary data such as cache files that are used while the node is operating, but are not a part of the permanent blockchain state.</p></li><li><p><code>config.toml</code>: Located in the node&#39;s root directory, this is the primary configuration file that defines core settings such as network parameters, P2P configuration, and API endpoints. This file is generated during node initialization.</p></li></ul>',4)]))}const f=t(a,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
