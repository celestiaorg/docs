# Speaker list

As a Modular Meetup organizer, we understand the importance
of delivering engaging and informative content to your attendees.
That's why we've created an exclusive Speaker List specifically
tailored for organizers participating in the Modular Meetup Program.
This resource gives you access to a curated selection of top-tier
speakers who are passionate about Celestia and the modular ecosystem.
Due to privacy, the list is not shared publicly but is accessible
to participants of the Modular Meetup program when they create a meetup.

The Speaker List features experts from Celestia Labs, as well as prominent
figures from the broader Celestia and modular communities. Each individual
is well-versed in various aspects of the modular ecosystem, ensuring that
your meetup attendees gain valuable insights and deepen their understanding
of modular blockchains.

By joining the Modular Meetup Program, you can enjoy the benefits of our Speaker
List and bring a touch of expertise to your events. The speakers can participate
either in person or virtually, depending on location and timing.

You can expect benefits from the Speaker List including high-quality presentations,
interactive Q&A sessions, and knowledge-sharing opportunities facilitated by the
best and brightest in the Celestia ecosystem. With our Speaker List, you'll be
able to create memorable and impactful Modular Meetups that foster genuine
connections and promote growth within the community.
