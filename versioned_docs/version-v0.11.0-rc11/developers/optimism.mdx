# Deploy an OP Stack testnet with Celestia

import constants from "../constants/constants.js";

````mdx-code-block
In order to deploy a testnet with Celestia, you will need to have a modified
version of `optimism-bedrock`.

## Install dependencies

You can find the steps to install dependencies
and the modified version [here](../optimism-devnet/).

## Pick your deployment type

Using Celestia and OP stack, you have the option to either
run a light node of your own or a `local-celestia-devnet`,
which will give you a local devnet to test things out with.

### Using a local devnet

If you'd like to use the `local-celestia-devnet`, you're in luck!
This is the default for the OP Stack + Celestia repository. Head
to the [previous page](../optimism-devnet/) to get started.

### Using a light node

:::caution
This is a **beta integration** and we are working on resolving open
[issues](https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimism/issues/).
The current testnet this setup is compatible with is the
[Arabica](../../nodes/arabica-devnet/) devnet.

In order to allow your light node to post
and retrieve data without errors, you will need to change `UseShareExchange`
to `false` in:
<pre><code>
$HOME/.celestia-light-{constants.bsrChainId}/config.toml
</code></pre>
:::

If you choose to use your own node store, the light node
must be **fully synced** and **funded** for you to be able to submit
and retrieve `PayForBlobs` to a Celestia network.

If it is not synced, you will run into [errors](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/issues/2151/).

Visit the [Arabica page](../../nodes/arabica-devnet/)
to visit the faucet.

In order to mount existing data, you must have a node store that is
in this directory:
<pre><code>$HOME/.celestia-light-{constants.bsrChainId}</code></pre>

This is the default location of the node store when you initialize and run a new Celestia node.

:::caution
The user in the `docker-compose-testnet.yml` is the `root` user,
but this is not meant to be used in production.
:::

By default, the node will run with the account named
`my_celes_key`.

If you have your own setup you'd like to try, you can always edit
`optimism/ops-bedrock/docker-compose-testnet.yml` to work with your setup.

### Using a RaaS provider

If you'd like to use a Rollups as a Service (RaaS) provider, you can do so
by going to the [RaaS category](../../category/rollups-as-a-service/).

## Build the testnet

Build TypeScript definitions for TS dependencies:

```bash
cd $HOME
cd optimism
make build-ts
```

Set environment variables to start network:

```bash
export SEQUENCER_BATCH_INBOX_ADDRESS=0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000000
export L2OO_ADDRESS=0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
```

## Start the testnet

First, make sure your light node is synced and funded.

Next, you can start up the testnet with the following command:

```bash
make testnet-up
```

## View the logs of the testnet

If you'd like to view the logs of the testnet, run the following command
from the root of the Optimism directory:

```bash
make testnet-logs
```

## Stop the testnet

To safely stop the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-down
```

## Clean the testnet

To remove all data from the testnet, run the following command:

```bash
make testnet-clean
```
