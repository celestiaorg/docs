# Integrate with Blobstream client

## Blobstream demo rollup

Rollups can use Blobstream for DA by posting their data to Celestia and then
proving that it was posted on Ethereum. This is done identically to how any
rollup or user would post data to Celestia. Then, a zero-knowledge proof that
Celestia validators have come to consensus on Celestia block headers is
generated, and subsequently relayed to Ethereum to the Blobstream X smart
contract.

This demo rollup will outline (the outline is not an
implementation! Please do not expect to copy and paste this code ðŸ™‚) a very
simple Blobstream rollup to illustrate at a high level what this could look
like.

## Defining a chain

The first step to starting a new chain is to define the structure of the
commitments that each block consists of.

```go
type Block struct {
    // Data is the data of a block that is submitted to Celestia.
    Data `json:"Data"`
    // Header is the set of commitments over a block that is submitted to
    // Ethereum.
    Header `json:"Header"`
}

// Data is the data of a block that is submitted to Celestia.
type Data struct {
    Txs []json.RawMessage `json:"txs"`
}

// Header is the set of commitments over a block that is submitted to Ethereum.
type Header struct {
    Height             uint64    `json:"height"`
    Namespace          []byte    `json:"namespace"`
    PreviousHash       []byte    `json:"previous_hash"`
    Span               Span      `json:"span"`
    SequencerSignature Signature `json:"sequencer_signature,omitempty"`
}
```

Note the Celestia-specific structures in the header such as the `Namespace` and
the Blobstream-specific structure called the `Span`. The goal of these
structures is to locate the data in the Celestia block so that we can prove
that data's inclusion via Blobstream if needed. Read more in the
[namespace specifications](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/specs/namespace.html),
and you can think of this like a chain ID. Learn more
[information about `shares`](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/specs/shares.html),
which are small pieces of the encoded Celestia block. We use the same encoding
here so that the commitments to the rollup block match those committed to by
validators in the Celestia data root.

The `Span` could take many forms, but in this demo, we will use the following:

```go
// Span describes the location of the rollup block data that is posted to
// Celestia. This is important for other nodes to be able to prove that data in
// the Celestia block. This can be thought of as a pointer to some data in the
// Celestia block.
type Span struct {
    // CelestiaHeight is the height of the Celestia block that contains the
    // rollup block data.
    CelestiaHeight uint64 `json:"celestia_height"`
    // DataShareStart is the index of the first share of the rollup block data.
    DataShareStart uint64 `json:"share_start"`
    // DataShareLen is length in shares of the rollup block data. This is used
    // to identify all of the rollup block data in a Celestia block.
    DataShareLen uint64 `json:"share_end"`
}
```

We can then define the blockchain as a collection of blocks and some additional
information about the chain such as the sequencer address.

```go
type Blockchain struct {
    Blocks           []Block
    SequencerAddress []byte
    Namespace        []byte
}
```

## Rollup sequencer

The rollup sequencer is responsible for creating blocks and, in this demo,
writing that data to Celestia and Ethereum. The rollup full node is responsible
for reading that data from Celestia and Ethereum and verifying that it follows
the protocol rules of that rollup.

Therefore, we can start by first defining the reading and writing interactions
rollup nodes will have with both the Celestia and Ethereum networks. The actual
implementations of these interfaces are left as exercises to the reader (ðŸ¤ª).
Assume that those implementations of these interfaces are verifying the
respective chain. For the connection to Celestia, this would likely mean
connecting to a Celestia light node,
which can detect faults in consensus such as hidden data. For the connection
to Ethereum, this would likely mean running and connecting to a full node.
More information on the RPC that is exposed by a Celestia light node can be found
[in the RPC documentation](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/?version=v0.11.0).
Additionally, if you need more information on how to run a light node, you can
[check out the documentation](../nodes/light-node.md).

```go
// CelestiaLightNodeClient summarizes the actions that a rollup that uses
// Blobstream for DA would need from a Celestia light node. Note that the actual
// connection to this light node is arbitrary, but would likely involve an RPC
// connection to a Celestia light node.
type CelestiaLightNodeClient interface {
    GetBlockData(Span) (Data, error)
    SubmitBlockData(Data) (Span, error)
}

// EthereumClient summarizes the actions that a rollup that uses Blobstream for
// DA would need from an Ethereum client.
type EthereumClient interface {
    // GetLatestRollupHeight returns the height of the latest rollup block by
    // querying the appropriate contract on Ethereum.
    LatestRollupHeight() (uint64, error)
    // GetHeader returns the rollup header of a specific height.
    GetHeader(uint64) (Header, error)
    // SubmitHeader submits a header to the rollup bridge contract on Ethereum.
    SubmitHeader(Header) error
}
```

Note that here we are waiting for the head to be posted to Ethereum, however, it
would likely be better to simply download that header from the p2p network or
directly from the sequencer instead.

For the purposes of this demo, we will be using a single centralized sequencer,
which can be defined by simply wrapping the full node to isolate the logic to
create blocks.

A rollup full node will just consist of some representation of a blockchain along
with clients to read from with Celestia and Ethereum.

```go
type Fullnode struct {
    Blockchain
    CelestiaLightNodeClient
    EthereumClient
}

// Sequencer wraps the demo Fullnode struct to add specific functionality for
// producing blocks.
type Sequencer struct {
    Fullnode
}
```

### Committing to data

Typical blockchains commit to the transactions included in each block using a
Merkle root. Rollups that use Blobstream for DA need to use the commitments that
are relayed to the Blobstream contracts.

For optimistic rollups, this could be as simple as referencing the data in the
Celestia block, not unlike using a pointer in memory. This is what is done below
via a `Span` in the [creating blocks](#creating-blocks) section. We keep track
of where the data is located in the Celestia block and the sequencer signs over
that location in the header. If the sequencer commits to non-existent data or an
invalid state root, then the invalid transaction is first proved to be included
in the `Span` before the rest of the fraud proof process is followed. Find more
information [in the inclusion proofs documentation](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/v3.0.0/docs/inclusion-proofs.md#blobstream-fraud-proofs).

For zk rollups, this would involve creating an inclusion proof to the data root
tuple root in the Blobstream contracts and then verifying that proof in the zk
proof used to verify state. Find more information in the
[data root inclusion proof documentation](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts/blob/master/docs/inclusion-proofs.md#1-data-root-inclusion-proof).

Also, see the documentation for the
[data square layout](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/v1.1.0/specs/src/specs/data_square_layout.md)
and the
[shares](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/specs/src/specs/shares.md)
of the Celestia block to see how the data is encoded in Celestia.

### Creating blocks

The first step in creating a block is to post the block data to Celestia. Upon
confirmation of the data being included in a block, the actual location of the
data in Celestia can be determined. This data is used to create a `Span` which
is included in the header and signed over by the sequencer. This `Span` can be
used by contracts on Ethereum that use the Blobstream contracts to prove some
specific data was included.

```go
func (s *Sequencer) ProduceBlock(txs []json.RawMessage) (Block, error) {
    data := Data{Txs: txs}

    span, err := s.CelestiaLightNodeClient.SubmitBlockData(data)
    if err != nil {
        return Block{}, err
    }

    var lastBlock Block
    if len(s.Blocks) > 0 {
        lastBlock = s.Blocks[len(s.Blocks)-1]
    }

    header := Header{
        Height:       uint64(len(s.Blocks) + 1),
        PreviousHash: lastBlock.Header.Hash(),
        Namespce:     s.Namespace,
        Span: span,
    }

    signature := s.key.Sign(header.SignBytes())

    header.SequencerSignature = signature

    block := Block{
        Data:   data,
        Header: header,
    }

    s.AddBlock(block)

    return block, nil
}
```

Note that the sequencer here is not yet posting headers to Ethereum. This is
because the sequencer is waiting for the commitments from the Celestia validator
set (the data root tuple roots) to be relayed to the contracts. Once the
contracts are updated, the sequencer can post the header to Ethereum.

```go
func (s *Sequencer) UpdateHeaders() error {
    latestRollupHeight, err := s.EthereumClient.LatestRollupHeight()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    for i := latestRollupHeight; i <= uint64(len(s.Blocks)+1); i++ {
        err := s.EthereumClient.SubmitHeader(s.Blocks[i].Header)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    return nil
}
```

## Rollup full node

### Downloading the block

There are a few different mechanisms that could be used to download blocks. The
simplest solution and what is outlined above is for `Fullnodes` to wait until the
blocks and the headers are posted to the respective chains, and then download
each as they are posted. It would also be possible to gossip the headers ahead
of time and download the rollup blocks from Celestia instead of waiting for the
headers to be posted to Ethereum. It's also possible to download the headers and
the block data like a normal blockchain via a gossiping network and only fall
back to downloading the data and headers from Celestia and Ethereum if the
gossiping network is unavailable or the sequencer is malicious.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```go
func (f *Fullnode) AddBlock(b Block) error {
    // Perform validation of the block
    if b.Header.Height != uint64(len(f.Blocks)+1) {
        return fmt.Errorf("failure to add block: expected block height %d, got %d", len(f.Blocks)+1, b.Header.Height)
    }
    // Check the sequencer's signature
    if !b.Header.SequencerSignature.IsValid(f.SequencerAddress) {
        return fmt.Errorf("failure to add block: invalid sequencer signature")
    }

    f.Blocks = append(f.Blocks, b)
    return nil
}

func (f *Fullnode) GetLatestBlock() error {
    nextHeight := uint64(len(f.Blocks) + 1)

    // Download the next header from ethereum before we download the block data
    // from Celestia. Note that we could alternatively download the header
    // directly from the sequencer instead of waiting.
    header, err := f.EthereumClient.GetHeader(nextHeight)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    data, err := f.CelestiaLightNodeClient.GetBlockData(header.Span)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return f.AddBlock(
        Block{
            Data:   data,
            Header: header,
        },
    )
}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

This outline of a Blobstream rollup isn't doing execution or state transitions
induced by the transactions, however, that step would occur here. If fraud is
detected, the fraud proof process will begin. The only difference between the
fraud proof process of a normal optimistic rollup and a rollup that uses
Blobstream for DA is that the full node would first prove the fraudulent
transaction was committed to by the Sequencer using the `Span` in the header and
before proceeding with the normal process.

[Celestia light node RPC](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/?version=v0.11.0#blob.Submit)
to submit the data to Celestia.

#### Posting headers to Ethereum

How headers are posted to Ethereum is entirely dependent upon how the rollup light
client contracts work. For examples of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain
programmatically, please see the [go-ethereum book](https://goethereumbook.org/en/transactions/)
