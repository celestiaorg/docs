# How to stake TIA

Celestia is a proof-of-stake blockchain based on the Cosmos SDK.

Staking TIA as a delegator allows you to secure the Celestia network. This means that you can stake the native token TIA and vote on governance proposals.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to stake TIA tokens via [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) and [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/) wallets.
