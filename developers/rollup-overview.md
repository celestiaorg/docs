# Deploy a rollup

This section provides various guides and tutorials that cover different
options for deploying rollups on Celestia.

## What is a rollup?

A rollup is a type of blockchain that offloads some work to a layer 1, like
Celestia. Rollups host applications and process user transactions. Once
those transactions get processed, they are then published to layer 1.
Itâ€™s layer 1s job to order those transactions and check that they are
available, at minimum.

Over time, two primary designs emerged for rollups:
[optimistic](https://celestia.org/glossary/optimistic-rollup/) and
[zk](https://celestia.org/glossary/zk-rollup) rollups.
