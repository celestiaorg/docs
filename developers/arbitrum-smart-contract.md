# Deploy a smart contract to your Arbitrum rollup

## Overview

Welcome to the guide on deploying a smart contract to your Arbitrum rollup. In
this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a smart contract using the L2 Nitro
devnet and the provided public and private keys for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- [Nitro rollup devnet](./arbitrum-deploy.md)
  running
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed on your machine
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Basic understanding of Ethereum
- Basic understanding of Solidity and Node.js

## Setup

First, in your `$HOME` directory, set up a new project folder for this
tutorial and init the project with npm:

```bash
cd $HOME
mkdir counter-project && cd counter-project && npm init -y
```

Next, initialize a Foundry project with the following command:

```bash
forge init counter_contract
```

## Create your smart contract

Take a look at the `Counter.sol` file in your
`counter-project/counter_contract/src` directory:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

The contract contains a public unsigned integer variable named "number".
There are two public functions in this contract. The `setNumber` function
allows anyone to set a new value for the "number" variable, while the
`increment` function increases the value of "number" by one each time it's
called.

You can
[learn more about Solidity and smart contract programming](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/learning-tools/).

To compile the contract, run the following forge command from the
`$HOME/counter-project/counter_contract/` directory:

```bash
forge build
```

Your output should look similar to the following:

```bash
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 21 files with 0.8.19
[⠑] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 1.24s
Compiler run successful
```

## Test your smart contract

Now, open the `test/Counter.t.sol` file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/Counter.sol";

contract CounterTest is Test {
    Counter public counter;

    function setUp() public {
        counter = new Counter();
        counter.setNumber(0);
    }

    function testIncrement() public {
        counter.increment();
        assertEq(counter.number(), 1);
    }

    function testSetNumber(uint256 x) public {
        counter.setNumber(x);
        assertEq(counter.number(), x);
    }
}
```

This file performs unit testing on the contract we created in the previous
section. Here's what the test is doing:

- The contract includes a public "Counter" type variable called "counter".
  In the `setUp` function, it initializes a new instance of the "Counter"
  contract and sets the "number" variable to 0.

- There are two test functions in the contract: `testIncrement` and
  `testSetNumber`.

- The `testIncrement` function tests the "increment" function of the
  "Counter" contract by calling it and then asserting that the "number" in
  the "Counter" contract is 1. It verifies if the increment operation
  correctly increases the number by one.

- The `testSetNumber` function is more generic. It takes an unsigned integer
  argument 'x' and tests the "setNumber" function of the "Counter" contract.
  After calling the "setNumber" function with 'x', it asserts that the
  "number" in the "Counter" contract is equal to 'x'. This verifies that the
  "setNumber" function correctly updates the "number" in the "Counter"
  contract.

Now, to test your code, run the following:

```bash
forge test
```

If the test is successful, your output should be similar to this:

```bash
[⠆] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Running 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testIncrement() (gas: 28334)
[PASS] testSetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 27709, ~: 28409)
Test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; finished in 8.96ms
```

## Deploying your smart contract

### Funded accounts

Your L2 Nitro devnet will have a
[public and private key funded as a faucet to use for testing](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node#default-endpoints-and-addresses):

- On both L1 and L2
  - Public key: `0x3f1Eae7D46d88F08fc2F8ed27FCb2AB183EB2d0E`
  - Private key:
    `0xb6b15c8cb491557369f3c7d2c287b053eb229daa9c22138887752191c9520659`

Alternatively, you can
[fund other addresses by using the scripts `send-l1` and `send-l2`](https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node#helper-scripts).

The L1 Geth devnet will be running at `http://localhost:8545` and the L2 Nitro
devnet will be on `http://localhost:8547` and `ws://localhost:8548`.

### Using our Arbitrum devnet

We will use the local RPC endpoint (`http://localhost:8547`) and accounts
above to test with.

Let's deploy the contract now. First, set a private key from anvil:

```bash
export L2_PRIVATE_KEY=0xe887f7d17d07cc7b8004053fb8826f6657084e88904bb61590e498ca04704cf2
export ARB_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547
```

Now, deploy the contract:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url $ARB_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $L2_PRIVATE_KEY \
  src/Counter.sol:Counter
```

A successful deployment will return output similar to below:

```bash
[⠆] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Deployer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
Deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
Transaction hash: 0xf1a793a793cd9fc588f5132d99008565ea361eb3535d66499575e9e1908200b2
```

Once you've deployed the contract, you're ready to interact with it!

First, we'll set it as a variable:

```bash
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

## Interacting with your smart contract

Foundry uses `cast`, a CLI for performing Ethereum RPC calls.

To write to the contract, we'll use the `cast send` command:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "setNumber(uint256)" 10 \
  --rpc-url $ARB_RPC_URL --private-key $L2_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Your output will look similar:

```bash
blockHash               0x131822bef6eb59656d7e1387c19b75be667e587006710365ec5cf58030786c42

transactionIndex        0
type                    2
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Now, we can make a read call to view the state of the number variable,
using the `cast call` command:

```bash
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "number()" --rpc-url $ARB_RPC_URL
```

The result will look similar:

```bash
0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a
```

Convert the result from hexadecimal to a base 10 value with:

```bash
echo $((0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a))
```
