# Nitrogen testnet

![nitrogen](/img/nitrogen.png)

[Nitrogen](https://rollup-info.altlayer.io/public/nitrogen)
is the first testnet and L3 made with
[Celestia's Arbitrum Nitro integration](./arbitrum-integration.md)
hosted by [AltLayer](https://altlayer.io/).

## Getting Started with Nitrogen

Find [chain information, RPCs, contract addresses, bridging information,
blob poster address, and more](https://rollup-info.altlayer.io/public/nitrogen)
on AltLayer's Nitrogen testnet page.

### Nitrogen tokens

To use the test network, you will need to
[use the Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io)
to bridge from:

1. Arbitrum Sepolia (L2) to Nitrogen (L3)
2. Sepolia (L1) to Arbitrum Sepolia (L2) to Nitrogen (L3)

Details for how to use the bridge to Nitrogen can be
[found on the Nitrogen page](https://rollup-info.altlayer.io/public/nitrogen).
