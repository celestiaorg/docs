# Introduction to Arbitrum rollups with Celestia as DA

![Celestia_Arbitrum](/img/Celestia-Arbitrum.png)

## Overview

The
[integration of Celestia with Arbitrum Orbit](https://blog.celestia.org/celestia-is-first-modular-data-availability-network-to-integrate-with-arbitrum-orbit/)
and the Nitro tech stack marks the first external contribution to the Arbitrum
Orbit protocol layer, offering developers an additional option for selecting
a data availability layer alongside Arbitrum AnyTrust. The integration allows
developers to deploy an Arbitrum Rollup that uses Celestia for data
availability and settles on Ethereum.

[Arbitrum Orbit](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction)
is a framework that enables the creation of customized, self-managed
Arbitrum Rollup and AnyTrust chains. Key highlights of Arbitrum Orbit
include:

1. **Creation of custom chains**: Orbit allows the creation of dedicated chains
   that settle to Arbitrum's Layer 2 chains (Arbitrum One, Nova, Goerli, Sepolia),
   with customizable features like throughput, privacy, gas token, and governance.
2. **Solving Ethereum's scalability**: Orbit addresses Ethereum's congestion
   and high demand for block space by enabling the creation of personal rollups,
   which offer scalable, secure alternatives to Ethereum's public chains.
3. **Decentralized application development**: Orbit chains provide dedicated
   throughput, EVM+ compatibility, independent roadmaps, and reliable gas prices
   enhancing the development and operation of decentralized apps.
4. **Benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem**: Orbit contributes to a multi-chain
   future for Ethereum, enhancing scalability, offering flexible security models,
   and enabling experimentation with execution environments and governance models.
5. **Versatility and interoperability**: Orbit chains can be used for a range
   of purposes, from hosting a single dApp to an ecosystem of dApps, with the
   capability to communicate with other Orbit chains.

### Blobstream

:::warning UPCOMING INTEGRATION
The Blobstream section is currently under development. Please note that
the integration with Blobstream is not yet finalized, but it is planned
for implementation in the near future.
:::

The Celestia and Arbitrum integration also
[includes Blobstream](./blobstream.md),
which relays commitments to Celestia’s data root to an onchain light client
on Ethereum. This allows L2 solutions that settle on Ethereum to benefit
from the scalability Celestia’s data availability layer can provide.

As part of this integration, Blobstream has been incorporated into the
Arbitrum `SequencerInbox.sol` contract.

In the `SequencerInbox.sol` contract, the `validateBatchData`
modifier has been designed to authenticate that the data root is
on Celestia when reading a batch of data. This is achieved by the
[following code by @Ferret-san](https://gist.github.com/Ferret-san/3d3fc1b5738ee8d77ad112c0eb8bbe5f):

Note that the data above is the bytes serialized version of this struct in Go:

```go
type BlobPointer struct {
   BlockHeight    uint64
   Start          uint64
   SharesLength   uint64
   Key            uint64
   NumLeaves      uint64
   TupleRootNonce uint64
   TxCommitment [32]byte
   DataRoot     [32]byte
   SideNodes    [][32]byte
}
```

### Ethereum fallback mechanism in Nitro

Another feature of this integration is the
[Ethereum fallback mechanism](./ethereum-fallback.md),
which enables Ethereum L2s (or L3s) to “fall back” to using Ethereum
calldata for data availability in the event of downtime on Celestia Mainnet
Beta.

In the case of Celestia downtime or temporary unavailability, L2s can
fallback to posting transactions as calldata on Ethereum or another DA
layer for data availability instead of posting to Celestia. This mechanism
ensures users can continue to transact securely and seamlessly, preventing
disruptions and helping to ensure user funds do not get stuck in the L2's
bridge on Ethereum. This feature is available for the
[Arbitrum Orbit integration](./ethereum-fallback.md#arbitrum).

By default in [Arbitrum Nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro), the
[Ethereum fallback mechanism in the `BatchPoster` function](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/batch_poster.go#L989-L1001)
is handling the process of storing data, with a fallback mechanism
to store data onchain if the primary data availability storage
fails.

The [@celestiaorg/nitro](https://github.com/celestiaorg/nitro) integration
[uses the same fallback mechanism](https://github.com/celestiaorg/nitro/blob/f01968eb3d4e19329e9c92b050e98a8e5772f1f2/arbnode/batch_poster.go#L845-L857).

The fallback logic for Celestia DA is configurable, providing an alternative
to the previous default fallback mechanism. Additionally, a method has been
added to the Arbitrum node software. This method allows the sequencer to call
`VerifyAttestation` to check if a data root has been posted on Blobstream or
not, before it sends the sequencer message (data pointer) to the underlying
chain.
