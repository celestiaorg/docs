# Requesting data commitment ranges

By default, the Blobstream X deployments on Ethereum will be
updating every 4 hours, and on Arbitrum One
and Base, updating every 1 hour. If you wish for the Blobstream X contract
to be updated at a different cadence, then you have several different
options for how to update the smart contract.

To request proofs to be submitted to the Blobstream X contract at a
different cadence, you can do one of the following:

## Recommended setup

Run the Blobstream X operator with hosted proving on the Succinct
platform, by running an operator script that pings the platform with
proof requests at a specified cadence.

[Follow these instructions to run the operator script](https://github.com/succinctlabs/blobstreamx?tab=readme-ov-file#operator-with-hosted-proving).

Here are example values for the `.env` file:

1. `TENDERMINT_RPC_URL` from
   [the public Celestia list](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/mainnet#consensus-nodes).
2. `SUCCINCT_RPC_URL` = `https://alpha.succinct.xyz/api`
3. Request for `SUCCINCT_API_KEY` from
   [the Succinct team](https://alpha.succinct.xyz/partner).
4. `CHAIN_ID` is the chain ID of the deployed Blobstream X contract.
5. `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Blobstream X proxy contract address.
6. `NEXT_HEADER_FUNCTION_ID` & `HEADER_RANGE_FUNCTION_ID`: Get the
   `functionId`'s from the Blobstream X contract by using the
   `nextHeaderFunctionId` and `headerRangeFunctionId` respectively,
   which are public storage variables.

## Local proving

To run the Blobstream X operator with local proving, follow this [guide](https://hackmd.io/@succinctlabs/HJE7XRrup).

:::tip
Note: Requires a large cloud machine to run in a reasonable
amount of time. EC2 r6a.16xlarge takes ~30 minutes to generate a
header range proof.

## Request proof onchain

Directly request a proof via the Blobstream X contract interface.
Unlike the Blobstream X operator which handles requests off-chain,
requesting on-chain requires gas, but the proof will be generated
and relayed by the Succinct platform.

1. Call `requestHeaderRange(uint64 _targetBlock)` with the end
   of the range you want a commitment for.

2. A `DataCommitmentStored(uint256, uint64, uint64, bytes32)`
   will be emitted for the requested range when it is stored in the
   contract. Listen to this event to know that the proof has been
   generated successfully.
