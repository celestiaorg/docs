# Quickstart: Deploy an Arbitrum Orbit rollup

This guide covers deploying a rollup using the
[Celestia Orbit chain deployment portal](https://orbit.celestia.org).

After completing this tutorial, you will have a local development network rollup
capable of hosting EVM-compatible smart contracts. This rollup will process
transactions locally, settle on the public Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, and post data to
Celestia's Mocha testnet.


If you're looking to learn more about the integration of Celestia and Orbit,
read the [Arbitrum Orbit integration overview](./arbitrum-integration.md). If you're
looking to learn more about Orbit, read
[A gentle introduction: Orbit chains](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction).

:::

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Ethereum, Ethereum's testnets, Arbitrum, and Celestia
- [A gentle introduction: Orbit chains](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction)
- [Arbitrum Orbit integration overview](./arbitrum-integration.md)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
  running on your machine
- [Docker Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- A fully synced and funded Mocha testnet [light node](../nodes/light-node.md)
on **v0.13.2**
  - [Mocha testnet faucet](../nodes/mocha-testnet.md#mocha-testnet-faucet)
- A browser-based Ethereum wallet (like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io))
- At least 1 Arbitrum Sepolia testnet ETH (for custom gas token chains,
0.6 ETH and 0.4 native tokens)

## Setup

This section was adapted from
[Arbitrum's Orbit quickstart](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart).

### Step 1: Acquire Arbitrum Sepolia ETH

You'll need at least 1 testnet ETH for a regular Orbit rollup
or 0.6 ETH plus 0.4 of your desired native token for Orbit rollups
with a custom gas token. The funds will cover the cost of deploying the
base contracts to the base chain, in this case, Arbitrum Sepolia.

The simplest way to do this is to:

1. Use an L1 testnet ETH faucet like [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
to acquire some testnet ETH on Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
2. Bridge your L1 testnet ETH to L2 Arbitrum Sepolia using the
[Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).

### Step 2: Pick your deployment type

Visit the
[Celestia Orbit chain deployment portal](https://orbit.celestia.org).
This portal offers the following options:

1. **Celestia Rollup: Transaction data is posted to Celestia**
2. Rollup: Transaction data is posted to Ethereum
3. AnyTrust: Transaction data is posted by a Data Availability Committee

Connect your wallet to the deployment portal. You may be prompted to
add the Arbitrum Sepolia network to your wallet and/or switch your
wallet to this network; approve this.

In this guide, we will select **Celestia ✨** and deploy a rollup
which posts data to Celestia (1 above).

![Choose Celestia for DA](/arbitrum/choose_da.png)

Click **Next**. In the next step, we will configure the deployment.

### Step 3: Configure your Orbit chain's deployment

The deployment portal will then display a form that looks like this:

![configuration](/arbitrum/configuration.png)

Parameter descriptions can be found in the table below (more in-depth
descriptions can be found in the deployment UI). We recommend sticking
to the defaults; to learn more about customizing your Orbit chain's
deployment configuration, visit
[How to customize your Orbit chain's deployment configuration](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/customize-deployment-configuration):

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| **Chain ID** | This is a unique integer identifier for your chain's network, primarily used on chain indexes like [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org). It's not crucial for development networks, but in production, you'll need to choose a unique ID.|
| **Chain Name** | The name you assign to your Orbit chain, which helps users and developers distinguish it from other chains. It should be memorable and recognizable.                                                            |
| **Challenge Period Blocks** | Determines the time frame within which validators can dispute the state of the chain posted to the base chain. It's measured in blocks on the underlying L1 chain. A longer period allows more time for disputes but also delays withdrawals.  |
| **Stake Token** | Specifies the token that validators must stake to participate in the validation process, using the token's contract address on the base chain. This can be ETH or another token, defined by its address.         |
| **Base Stake** | The minimum amount of stake token required for validators to post state assertions. A lower base stake lowers the barrier to entry but increases vulnerability to attacks, whereas a higher stake encourages honest participation but raises the entry barrier.|
| **Owner** | The account address that has the authority to deploy, own, and update the base contracts of your Orbit chain on its base chain. In production, this is usually a high-stakes address controlled by a DAO or a multisig setup. For development chains, it's a lower-stakes administrative account.|
| **Gas Token** | The token used for gas payments on the network, which must be natively deployed on the parent chain. There are specific requirements for custom gas tokens, such as having 18 decimals and not being a rebasing or fee-on-transfer token. This feature is primarily for Orbit AnyTrust chains.|
| **Validators** | This is the number of validators for your chain, including their addresses. The first validator is auto-generated and immutable. Validators are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the chain and posting state assertions to the base chain.|
| **Batch Poster** | Responsible for posting transaction batches from your Orbit chain to the base chain. An address for this role is automatically generated, with the private key stored in a configuration file.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

In the **Configure Validators** section, specify the number of validators
and their addresses for your chain. The initial validator's address is
pre-generated and immutable, with its key stored in a JSON file.
Validators ensure transaction integrity and state assertions on the base
chain. They're added to an allow-list for validation and staking.
**Base contracts** refer to your Orbit chain's L2 contracts, and **base chain**
to the L2 chain they're deployed on.

In the **Configure Batch Poster** section, a batch poster address is
auto-generated for posting transaction batches to the base contracts
on the base chain. The address and its private key are also stored in
a JSON configuration file. After configuring, proceed to review and
deploy your Orbit chain.

After configuring your batch poster, proceed to the next step.

### Step 3: Review & Deploy your Orbit chain

Now, deploy your chain's base contracts to Arbitrum Sepolia!

Click the **Deploy** button on the **Review & Deploy** page.
Your wallet should prompt you to submit a transaction to the
Arbitrum testnet. You'll have to pay a little gas; your wallet
may denominate this in ETH; as long as you see your chosen
Arbitrum testnet in the transaction details, this gas fee will
be paid in testnet ETH.

Before proceeding, let's briefly review what just happened:

1. You submitted a deployment transaction to an Orbit "factory"
smart contract on the Arbitrum testnet, the public L2 chain
that your local Orbit chain will settle transactions to.
2. This Orbit smart contract then initialized your Orbit
chain's base contracts with the values that you specified in
the previous step, and deployed these base contracts to the
Arbitrum testnet.

Your Orbit chain's base contracts are responsible for
facilitating the exchange of information between your chain's
node(s) and its base chain's nodes. This includes the batch
posting of transactions from your Orbit chain to its base
chain, the staking of tokens by your Orbit chain's validators
the challenge mechanism, bridging mechanisms, and more.

Once your transaction is complete, continue to Step 4 to
download your chain's configuration files and launch your chain.

### Step 4: Download your chain's configuration files and launch your chain

After configuring your chain, you will need to download the necessary configuration files to launch your chain. Click the **Download zip files** button to download both the Rollup Config and L3 Config in a single ZIP file.

- **Rollup Config**: This is the `nodeConfig.json` file, encapsulating your chain's node configuration. It is crucial as it contains the private keys for your validator and batch poster, essential for signing transactions for RBlocks and batch postings to your chain's base contracts on the L2 chain.

- **L3 Config**: This is the `orbitSetupScriptConfig.json` file, which holds your chain's configuration, including configurations needed for your Token Bridge contracts.

Ensure to securely store these downloaded files as they contain sensitive information crucial for your chain's operation.

![download config](/arbitrum/download-config.png)

### Step 5: Clone the setup script repository and add your configuration files

1. Clone the [orbit-setup-script](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orbit-setup-script/tree/main)
repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/orbit-setup-script.git
    ```

2. Move the `nodeConfig.json` and `orbitSetupScriptConfig.json`
files that you downloaded into the `config` directory in the
root of your cloned `orbit-setup-script` repository.

3. Install dependencies by running `yarn install` from the root of the `orbit-setup-script` repository.

### Step 6: Pick an L2 RPC URL for the Batch Poster

In order for the Batch Poster, which is responsible for posting batches of data, to
subscribe to Blobstream's smart contract events, the node most use a WebSocket
connection, since an HTTP one will not support subscriptions. This RPC URL is different
from the `parent-chain.connection.url` object used in the node config, and is
not necessary when running a full node. WebSocket (WSS) URLs which are
essential for real-time data fetching and interaction with the
Arbitrum Sepolia network. 

To establish a WebSocket connection for your rollup to Arbitrum Sepolia, it's
recommended to
[find an RPC provider with WSS connections from Arbitrum's docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/node-providers).

For this example, we will make an account on Alchemy. Follow these steps to set up your account and obtain a WSS URL using Alchemy: 

1. Visit [Alchemy's website](https://www.alchemy.com/) and sign up for an account.
2. Once logged in, create a new app by selecting the Arbitrum network, specifically
targeting the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet.
3. After creating your app, navigate to the "API key" section to find your WebSocket
(WSS) URL.
4. In the next step, use this WSS URL in your `nodeConfig.json` under the
`celestia-cfg.eth-rpc` object to ensure your node can establish a
WebSocket connection to the Arbitrum Sepolia network
and successfully subscribe to Blobstream events. 

Without a WSS connection, the Batch Poster won't be able to subscribe to Blobstream
events, and thus will fall back to posting data to parent chain.

### Step 7: Run your light node for Mocha testnet

First, be sure that your light node is running, using a command similar to:

:::tip
If you are on Linux (or are not using Docker desktop), you may need to add the extra flags:
`--rpc.addr 0.0.0.0` and `--rpc.port 26658` to your start command
for your light node.

Additionally, you will need to add `host.docker.internal` as
a host in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```
:::

```bash
celestia light start --p2p.network mocha --core.ip <RPC_URL>
```

To set your light node's auth token, you will use the auth
token that returns when you run:

```bash
celestia light auth admin --p2p.network mocha
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

Since the contracts deployed through the factories above are already configured
to communicate with Blobstream, you now only have to configure your node
accordingly. First understand the different variables that will be set in the config:

- **`enable`:** set it to true if you are using Celestia DA 😁
- **`rpc`:** RPC endpoint for **celestia-node**
- **`tendermint-rpc`:** a celestia-core endpoint from a full node
(**NOTE:** only needed for a batch poster node)
- **`eth-rpc`:** Ethereum Client WSS RPC endpoint, only used when the node is a batch
poster. The eth-rpc must be WSS. Otherwise, it won't be able to subscribe to events
for Blobstream.
- **`namespace-id`:** namespace being used to post data to Celestia
- **`auth-token`:** auth token for your Celestia Node
- **`is-poster`:** is the node with Celestia DA the batch poster, set to true if so.
- **`gas-price`:** how much to pay for gas (in uTIA)
- **`event-channel-size`:** size of the events channel used by the batch poster
to wait for a range of headers that contains the header for the block in which
it posted a blob, before posting the batch to the base layer for verification
on Blobstream X.
- **`blobstreamx-address`:** address of the Blobstream X contract on the base chain.
    - Note that the `SequencerInbox` contract for each chain has a constant
    address for the `BlobstreamX` contract, thus make sure that the Blobstream X
    address in the `SequencerInbox` being used for the templates in
    `RollupCreator` matches the one in your config.

Now enable Celestia DA in your Arbitrum chain params in
`config/nodeConfig.json`. If you'd like to use your own namespace,
use a custom 10 byte value or random value using
`openssl rand -hex 10` for `namespace-id`:

:::warning
The Orbit contracts depend on
[the existing Blobstream X deployments](#blobstream-x-contract-deployments).
Before using these addresses, **please verify the contract addresses** on
[the official source below](#blobstream-x-contract-deployments)
to avoid any issues due to incorrect addresses.
This is crucial to protect against potential misuse by copy-paste errors.
:::

```ts
"celestia-cfg": {
  "enable": true,
  "rpc": "http://host.docker.internal:26658",
  "tendermint-rpc": "http://consensus-full-mocha-4.celestia-mocha.com:26657",
  "eth-rpc": "wss://<YOUR_ETH_RPC_WSS_URL>",
  "namespace-id": "<YOUR_10_BYTE_NAMESPACE>",
  "auth-token": "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>",
  "is-poster": true,
  "gas-price": 0.3,
  "event-channel-size": 100,
  "blobstreamx-address": "0xc3e209eb245Fd59c8586777b499d6A665DF3ABD2",
}
```

[See the compatibility matrix in the appendix to verify you're using the right versions.](#compatibility-matrix)

### Step 8: Run your chain's node and block explorer

Start Docker, then run `docker-compose up -d` from the root of
the `orbit-setup-script` repository.

A Nitro node and BlockScout explorer instance will be started. Visit
http://localhost/ to access your BlockScout explorer instance -
this will allow you to view your chain's transactions and
blocks, which can be useful for debugging.

![blockscout](/arbitrum/blockscout.png)

After you have some activity on your rollup, it will look more like this:

![explorer-view](/arbitrum/explorer-view.png)

### Step 9: Finish setting up your chain

The Offchain Labs team has provided a Hardhat script that
handles the following tasks:

1. Fund the **batch-poster** and **validator** (staker) accounts on your underlying L2 chain.
2. Deposit ETH into your account on the chain using your chain's newly deployed bridge.
3. Deploy your Token Bridge contracts on both L2 and local Orbit chains.
4. Configure parameters on the chain.

To run this script, issue the following command from the root
of the `orbit-setup-script` repository, replacing
`YourPrivateKey` with the private key of the `Owner` account you
used to deploy your chain's contracts, and replacing `http://localhost:8449` with the RPC URL of your chain's node.

First, export your private key as a variable:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY="YourPrivateKey" \
  L2_RPC_URL="https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc" \
  L3_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8449" yarn run setup
```

Successful logs will appear similar to:
