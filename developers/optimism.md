# Run an OP Stack rollup with Celestia underneath

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<script setup>
import constants from '/.vitepress/constants/constants.js'
</script>

This guide will show you how to run your own OP Stack devnet and testnet that posts data to Celestia's Mocha testnet using [roll-op](https://github.com/celestiaorg/roll-op) and [op-plasma-celestia](https://github.com/celestiaorg/op-plasma-celestia).

If you don't have devops experience and would like to use a Rollups as a Service (RaaS) provider, see the RaaS category in the menu.

## Dependency setup

- [celestia-node](../nodes/celestia-node.md)
- [roll-op](https://github.com/celestiaorg/roll-op?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites)

### Setting up your light node

Sync and fund a Celestia light node. The light node must be **fully synced** and **funded** for you to be able to submit and retrieve `PayForBlobs` to Mocha Testnet. This allows your rollup to post and retrieve data without any errors.

In order to mount existing data, you must have a node store that is in the default directory:

::: code-group

```bash-vue [Mocha]
$HOME/.celestia-light-{{constants.mochaChainId}}
```

```bash-vue [Mainnet Beta]
$HOME/.celestia-light
```

```bash-vue [Arabica]
$HOME/.celestia-light-{{constants.arabicaChainId}}
```

:::

By default, the node will run with the account named `my_celes_key` on Mocha. This is the account that needs to be funded.

::: tip
Unless you changed your configuration, you won't have to change anything. ðŸ˜Ž

## Deploying a devnet to Mocha

See [the Alt-DA x Celestia README](https://github.com/celestiaorg/op-plasma-celestia/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on [how to deploy a Devnet](https://github.com/celestiaorg/op-plasma-celestia/blob/main/README.md#devnet).

:::tip TIP for macOS users
If you are on macOS, you will need to run a `venv` before starting `roll-op`.

```sh
cd $HOME/roll-op
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

:::

Congrats! Your devnet is running on a mock EVM chain and Celestia Mocha.

## Deploying a testnet to an L1 (or L2) and Mocha

See [the Alt-DA x Celestia README](https://github.com/celestiaorg/op-plasma-celestia/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on [how to deploy a Testnet](https://github.com/celestiaorg/op-plasma-celestia/blob/main/README.md#testnet).

:::tip
If you are using a public RPC for your EVM chain, you should to enable `deploy_slowly = true` in your `config.toml`. If you still have issues, we recommend running the
integration with a high-availability, paid endpoint.
:::

When you are deploying to a live EVM network, pay attention and modify the configuration to post to non-Sepolia EVM chains.

Here is an example:

```toml
# Chain ID of your rollup
l2_chain_id = 1117733 

# Sepolia Ethereum
l1_chain_id = 11155111
l1_rpc_url = "https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com"

## Avoid issues with public RPC
deploy_slowly = true

## Keys
contract_deployer_account = "0xaddress"
contract_deployer_key = "privatekey"
batcher_account = "0xaddress"
batcher_key = "privatekey"
proposer_account = "0xaddress"
proposer_key = "privatekey"
admin_account = "0xaddress"
admin_key = "privatekey"
p2p_sequencer_account = "0xaddress"
p2p_sequencer_key = "privatekey"
```

Your `0xaddress` key must also be funded with testnet ETH. We recommend at least 10 SepoliaETH to get your chain started, but you will need more to keep it running longer.

## Congratulations

Congrats! You now have an OP Stack rollup running with Celestia underneath.
