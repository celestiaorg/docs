# IBC relaying guide

Celestia uses [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.dev/)
(Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol) to enable cross-chain
transfer of tokens. To support this capability it relies on
relayers, processes that can be run by anyone which constantly
scan for outbound packets on one chain and submits these packets
alongside corresponding proofs on the destination chain. This
section describes how one can setup a relayer and create new
connections between chains. There
are two standard implementations:

- [Hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/) built in Rust
- [Go Relayer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/relayer) built in Go

The following guide explains how to establish IBC connections and relay
packets between [Mocha testnet](../nodes/mocha-testnet.md) and
[Cosmos hub testnet](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/join-testnet.html)
networks by using the Hermes relayer.

Check the [latest celestia-app release's `go.mod`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/2b8cc9e23826ccb658b7dd5aa6cd51a0921a0c29/go.mod#L35)
for the version of ibc-go that is currently used.

## Hermes

[Hermes](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes) is an open-source
Rust implementation of an IBC relayer released as part of the
`ibc-relayer-cli` crate. It includes a CLI for relaying packets between
Cosmos SDK chains, as well as Prometheus metrics and a REST API.

Please follow the steps at [Hermes Quick Start](https://hermes.informal.systems/quick-start/)
to install Hermes. Before proceeding, verify that Hermes is installed correctly by
running `hermes version`.

:::tip
Hermes currently doesn't support configuring the Tendermint `CompatMode` in
chain config (see
[hermes#3623](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3623)). Until
that issue is resolved, please use Hermes
[v1.7.0](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/releases/tag/v1.7.0)+ because
it falls back to Tendermint `CompatMode` v0.34 (see
[hermes#3663](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/3663)) which is
compatible with Celestia.

:::

### Configuration

After you have successfully installed Hermes and created the necessary folders,
you now have to edit `config.toml` and add the appropriate configurations for
the chains you want to relay between.

For this tutorial, we will be using the following chains:

- Celestia's `mocha-4` testnet
- Cosmos Hub's `theta-testnet-001` testnet

Edit the Hermes configuration.

```bash
vim $HOME/.hermes/config.toml
```

```toml
[global]
log_level = "info"

[mode.clients]
enabled = true
refresh = true
misbehaviour = true

[mode.connections]
enabled = false

[mode.channels]

### Add relayer wallets

Now that we have successfully configured our relaying chains, we
need to import the wallets that will be used for relaying. Please
note that both wallets need to be funded with the native tokens of
each chain.

You can get testnet tokens from faucets for bot testnets via Discord:

- Celestia: [https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity](https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity)
- Cosmos Hub: [https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork)

Add your seed phrase to a file and upload it to the server. Do not
use wallets for anything else but relaying to avoid running into
account sequence errors.

Follow the steps at
[adding-keys-to-hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/commands/keys/index.html#adding-keys-to-hermes)
to add keys for each chain

```bash
hermes keys add --chain mocha-4 --mnemonic-file <seed-file>
hermes keys add --chain theta-testnet-001 --mnemonic-file <seed-file>
```

### Verify configuration files

After editing `config.toml` and adding wallet keys, it’s time to
test the configurations and ensure the system is healthy. Run the following:

```bash
hermes health-check
hermes config validate
```

If everything was set up correctly, you should see output like:

```bash
SUCCESS performed health check for all chains in the config
SUCCESS "configuration is valid"
```

## Create a connection between 2 chains

If you’re attempting to create new connections, verify
that the chains in question don’t already have connections and clients in
place and use the existing ones if they do. In that case you can
**skip this step** and go to [Configure channels in Hermes](#configure-channels-in-hermes)
section.

In this example, we are creating new clients and a new connection between `mocha-4`
and `theta-testnet-001` networks.

## Create clients

To learn if a client already exists, you can use the following command:

```bash
hermes query clients --host-chain mocha-4 --reference-chain theta-testnet-001
```

To create a new client, use the
[`create-client` command](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/commands/path-setup/clients.html#create-client):

```bash
hermes create client --host-chain mocha-4 --reference-chain theta-testnet-001
```

Create a second client:

```bash
hermes create client --host-chain theta-testnet-001 --reference-chain mocha-4
```

### Open connection over new clients

To create a new connection over clients, use the following command:

```bash
hermes create connection --a-chain mocha-4 --b-chain theta-testnet-001
```

You should be seeing a similar output to this:

```bash
SUCCESS Connection {
    delay_period: 0ns,
    a_side: ConnectionSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "theta-testnet-001",
                version: 0,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-2382",
        ),
        connection_id: Some(
            ConnectionId(
                "connection-2727",
            ),
        ),
    },
    b_side: ConnectionSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "mocha-4",
                version: 4,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-0",
        ),
        connection_id: Some(
            ConnectionId(
                "connection-0",
            ),
        ),
    },
}
```

Now that the connection has been established over the clients,
we need to create a new channel, by leveraging an existing connection:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
hermes create channel --a-chain theta-testnet-001 --a-connection connection-2727 --a-port transfer --b-port transfer
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

You should be seeing a similar output to this:

```bash
SUCCESS Channel {
    ordering: Unordered,
    a_side: ChannelSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "theta-testnet-001",
                version: 0,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-2382",
        ),
        connection_id: ConnectionId(
            "connection-2727",
        ),
        port_id: PortId(
            "transfer",
        ),
        channel_id: Some(
            ChannelId(
                "channel-3152",
            ),
        ),
        version: None,
    },
    b_side: ChannelSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "mocha-4",
                version: 4,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-0",
        ),
        connection_id: ConnectionId(
            "connection-0",
        ),
        port_id: PortId(
            "transfer",
        ),
        channel_id: Some(
            ChannelId(
                "channel-0",
            ),
        ),
        version: None,
    },
    connection_delay: 0ns,
}
```

:::tip Congratulations!

You have successfully created a new IBC connection between two networks.

:::

### Configure channels in Hermes

Now that we have created new connections and opened channels, we need to
edit `config.toml` again and add the newly created channels, or use the
already existing ones.

For `mocha-4` add:

```bash
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  ['transfer', 'channel-0'], # theta-testnet-001
]
```

For `theta-testnet-001` add:

```bash
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  ['transfer', 'channel-3108'], # mocha-4
]
```

## Start the relayer

Start the relayer via [`hermes start`](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/commands/relaying/index.html#the-start-command)

## Transfer

The Celestia state machine is built with the IBC transfer
module, allowing for the native Celestia token to be
transferred to any other IBC enabled chain. Transfer can
be initialized through the `celestia-appd` CLI. Information
can be found via the help label as follows:

```bash
celestia-appd tx ibc-transfer transfer --help
```

### Token filter

The transfer module uses a token filter middleware which
serves to prevent non-native Celestia tokens from being
on Celestia. If a user is to try to send a token from another
chain across, it will be simply rejected and the token returned
back to the user.
