# Staking on Celestia

Engage with the Celestia network at a deeper level through staking. An
essential mechanism to a proof-of-stake network, users can secure the
network by delegating to a validator and receive a share of its
staking rewards.

Currently, the following staking interfaces exist for the
[Mainnet Beta](../nodes/mainnet.md).

Just connect your wallet to get started!
