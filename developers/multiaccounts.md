# MultiAccounts feature for blobs submission

## Overview

By default, a celestia-node creates a key named `my_celes_key` during
initialization. This document explains how to run a node with a different
default key name and how to submit blobs using different signers.

## Running a node with a different default key name

To start a Celestia node with a different default key name, use the following
command:

```sh
celestia light start --core.ip=consensus.celestia-arabica-11.com \
    --p2p.network=arabica --keyring.keyname testKey
```

In this example, `testKey` becomes the default node key, and the
node's address will change accordingly.

## Submitting blobs with a different signer/key name

### Option 1: Submit passing key name

You can submit a blob by specifying a different key name:

```sh
celestia blob submit 0x42690c204d39600fddd3 'gm' --key.name testKey2
```

This transaction will be signed by the address associated with `testKey2`.

### Option 2: Submit passing signer address

Alternatively, you can submit a blob by specifying the signer's address:

```sh
celestia blob submit 0x42690c204d39600fddd3 'gm' --signer $SIGNER_ADDRESS
```

Both options achieve the same result but use different inputs. The
`testKey2` points to `SIGNER_ADDRESS` in the KeyStore.

## Key management

All keys and addresses must be added to the KeyStore. To create a new key,
use the [`cel-key` library](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/blob/main/cmd/cel-key/main.go):

### Creating a new key

```sh
./cel-key add testKey --keyring-backend test \
    --node.type light --p2p.network arabica
```

### Importing an existing key

```sh
./cel-key import
```

## Optional flags for write transactions

All other flags are now optional for all write transactions. This
means you don't have to specify gas/fee parameters each time.
The configuration can handle it for you automatically.


The default configuration applies to all write transactions,
including those in the [state module](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#state)
and [blob.Submit](https://node-rpc-docs.celestia.org/#blob.Submit).
This simplifies the process of submitting transactions and
reduces the need for manual input.
