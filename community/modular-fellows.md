# Modular Fellows

![Modular Fellows](/img/modular_fellows.jpg)

Modular Fellows is a program designed to empower modular builders with the
right resources to build the future of scalable and sovereign blockchain networks.

Over the course of the three month program, Modular Fellows will receive engineering
support, mentorship, and a monthly stipend of $3,000 to build a project of their
choice. After the program, continuing support will be available for Fellows in the
form of fundraising help and grants.

Applications are currently closed. Check back for details about future cohorts.

## Overview

### Milestones

Each month, the Fellows will complete a project milestone, culminating in a
demo-day presentation.

- **Month 1** - Learning and Exploring (start building whenever youâ€™re ready)

  In this month, you will immerse yourself in modular blockchains to come up
  with ideas of protocols, tools or applications to build during the rest
  of the program.

  - _Milestone - present an idea that you want to pursue_

- **Month 2** - Designing & Implementing a Basic Prototype

  In this month, you will design and implement a basic prototype of the
  idea that you settled on during the first month.

  - _Milestone - present the prototype for feedback_

- **Month 3** - Build out the Prototype into a Functional Product

  In this month, you will expand on your prototype to build a functional
  product which you will demo and explain with a write up.

  - _Milestone - demo, write up of product_

## Project ideas

Fellows do not need to have a specific project idea at the start of the program,
but you will need to settle on one by the end of the first month. There are no
right or wrong ideas, but here are a few to get you thinking:

- New execution layers, e.g. a Move rollup
- Rollup infrastructure services, e.g. one click deploy rollup sequencers
- Modular interoperability solutions, e.g. settlement layers or bridges
- Modular versions of the following
  - Popular DeFi apps e.g. AMMs & lending protocols
  - NFT platforms
  - Naming services like [ENS](https://etherscan.io/token/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72#code)
  - Social graphs like [Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz)

## Support

1. **Weekly office hours**

   _An optional meeting to ask questions, get help and receive feedback._

   Wednesdays alternating at 8:00am or 6:00pm Central US time.

2. **Lessons & tutorials**

   _Presentations from Celestia Labs team members & mentors explaining key
   concepts or giving tutorials on specific tools._

3. **Demos from participants**

   _Presentations from fellows about what they are working on for feedback._

4. **Communication**

   _Fellows will share a Telegram group with other Modular Fellows and Modular Mentors._

5. **Monthly stipend**

   _Fellows will receive $3,000.00 per month paid on completion of each milestone._

## Continuation

Though the program lasts only 3 months, we will provide you with continuing
support in the following ways.

- **Grants & Funding -** We will assist you in fundraising or in applying for a
  grant so that you can continue building your project.
- **Alumni Network** - You will be inducted into the Modular Fellows alumni network
  where you can keep in touch with other past and future Modular Fellows.
